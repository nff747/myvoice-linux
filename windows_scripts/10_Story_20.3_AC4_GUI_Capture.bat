REM Story 20.3 AC #4 - GUI first-generation TTFA capture
REM ========================================
REM Confirms through the REAL app that compile priming now runs and that
REM the user's first generation is fast. Stories 20.1/20.2 measured this
REM with a headless harness; the GUI path was dead until Story 20.3.
REM
REM This launches MyVoice 5 times in a row, one CSV per launch.
REM
REM WHAT TO DO IN EACH LAUNCH:
REM   1. Make sure a CLONED voice is the active profile so BASE is the
REM      resident model. This is the common user path Story 20.3 targets.
REM   2. WAIT for the "Preparing TTS engine" indicator to disappear.
REM      THIS MATTERS: priming holds the request semaphore, so generating
REM      while it is up measures queueing, not first-forward. The number
REM      would look like a regression and would not be one.
REM   3. Generate ONE utterance. Same text every launch.
REM   4. Close the app with the X. MYVOICE_AUTO_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1 is set below,
REM      so X really quits instead of minimizing to tray. Do NOT use Ctrl-C,
REM      and do not close while it is still generating.
REM   5. The next launch starts automatically.
REM
REM Note: cmd.exe parses a literal close-paren inside a for /L body as the
REM end of the block - that bug silently cost Story 18.4 a whole run. This
REM script uses a goto loop and paren-free echoes to stay clear of it.

REM to tray -- minimize_to_tray defaults True -- and closing from the taskbar
REM leaves the process alive, so this script never regains control and the
