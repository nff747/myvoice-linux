- Subsequent launches will use the cached model (no download needed)

================================================================================
VOICE CLONING (QWEN3-TTS)
================================================================================

MyVoice uses embedded Qwen3-TTS for high-quality voice cloning:

- Works completely offline after initial model download
- Clone any voice with just 3-15 seconds of audio
- Supports emotion control via natural language prompts
- Three model types: Base (clone), CustomVoice, VoiceDesign

First-time TTS use will download models (~3.4GB). This is automatic
and only happens once per model type.
