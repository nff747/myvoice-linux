"""Env-var-gated CSV capture for the progressive-playback + first-audio
instrumentation metrics.

Originally Story 18.1 Task 1.4 (three producer/consumer chunk metrics).
Widened twice since: Story 18.2 Task 4.1 added ``first_chunk_latency_ms``,
and Story 20.1 Task 2.1 added the six ``ttfa_*`` first-audio segment
boundaries. **Ten metric names are captured today** — the authoritative list
is ``_CAPTURED_METRIC_NAMES`` below; this prose is a summary of it, not a
second source of truth.

Engages a single ``metrics.add_listener`` callback that filters for:

  * ``progressive_chunk_emit_ms``                 (producer / qwen_tts_service.py)
  * ``progressive_chunk_playback_arrival_ms``     (consumer / app.py)
  * ``progressive_chunk_audio_duration_ms``       (consumer / app.py)
  * ``first_chunk_latency_ms``                    (producer / qwen_tts_service.py)
    — added by Story 18.2 Task 4.1 so the same env-var-gated capture
    surface drives the NFR1 first-chunk-latency before/after measurement
    for Stories 18.2 + 18.3 + 18.4. The chunk-specific tag columns
    (chunk_index / is_final / audio_data_size) are blank for these rows;
    downstream analysis distinguishes by ``metric_name``.

and writes one row per record to a CSV file. Every other metric in the
stream is ignored — the file stays focused on the Story 18.1 ratio
analysis (inter-chunk-emit interval vs chunk audio-duration) plus the
Story 20.1 four-segment first-audio decomposition, so the post-processing
script does not have to filter at parse time.

**CSV schema note (Story 20.1).** The header is deliberately unchanged:
``metric_name, value, session_id, chunk_index, is_final, audio_data_size``.
The ``ttfa_*`` rows therefore carry their ``frames`` / ``path`` /
``pcm_samples`` / ``text_length`` / ``buffer_mode`` tags only in the
structured ``myvoice.metrics`` log, not in a CSV column — a deliberate
trade so the schema Stories 18.1-18.4 already consume does not churn.
Downstream analysis distinguishes rows by ``metric_name``.

Activation
----------
Set the environment variable ``MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV`` before
launching the application. Three accepted forms:

    MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV=1
        Write to the default path:
        ``<logs_dir>/progressive-playback-instrumentation.csv``
        (story-agnostic filename; the file captures four metrics that
        span Stories 18.1 + 18.2 and will be reused by 18.3 + 18.4).
        Story 18.1's canonical baseline at
        ``_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-1-instrumentation-rtx5090-longform.csv``
        is preserved separately and is NOT overwritten by ``=1``.

    MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV=/abs/path/to/file.csv
        Write to the given absolute path.

    MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV=relative/path.csv
        Write to the given path resolved against ``<logs_dir>``.

Unset (or any other value the env-var resolution rejects) → capture is
disabled. There is no production overhead when the env-var is unset:
``enable_csv_capture`` returns ``None`` immediately.

Lifecycle
---------
``enable_csv_capture(path)`` opens the file, writes the CSV header,
registers the listener, and returns a zero-arg ``stop`` callable. The
caller (``MyVoiceApp``) invokes ``stop()`` from the ``aboutToQuit``
cleanup so the file flushes + closes deterministically. Idempotent:
calling ``stop()`` twice is a silent no-op.

Concurrency
-----------
The listener is invoked synchronously from inside ``metrics.record``
(which holds no lock at invocation time — see metrics.py:130-153). The
listener writes to the CSV file under a small ``threading.Lock`` so
producer-thread emissions (``_wrapped_post`` runs on the talker /
worker thread) cannot interleave-corrupt with consumer-thread emissions
(``_handle_progressive_chunk_async`` runs on the qasync event loop).
