            #
            # Two defects had to be closed to get this to run at all:
            #
            # 1. ORDERING (Story 20.2 §6). The warmup used to be scheduled
            #    *above* the preload, and ``_run_async_task`` only schedules.
            #    The coroutine therefore first ran at the enclosing coroutine's
            #    next suspension point — the ``await preload_model(...)``
            #    itself — with no model loaded, so every launch exited at
            #    ``reason="no_model_loaded"``.
            #
            # 2. QASYNC RE-ENTRANCY (the AC #4 capture, 2026-09-01). Moving the
            #    schedule below the preload was necessary but NOT sufficient:
            #    the task was created and then destroyed before its body ran,
            #    with ``RuntimeError: Cannot enter into task <Task-6> while
            #    another task <Task-1 running at main.py:397> is being
            #    executed``. Under qasync, ``call_soon`` is implemented as
            #    ``QObject.startTimer(0)`` (``qasync/__init__.py``:
            #    ``call_soon`` -> ``call_later(0, ...)`` -> ``_SimpleTimer.
            #    add_callback``), so a queued task step is delivered by
            #    ``timerEvent`` during **any** Qt event processing — including
            #    the synchronous ``splash.showMessage(...)`` /
            #    ``processEvents()`` stretch that ``main.py`` runs *inside*
            #    Task-1 straight after startup returns. ``asyncio._enter_task``
            #    refuses to step a second task while Task-1 is mid-step, the
            #    RuntimeError is swallowed by the loop's exception handler, and
            #    the task dies pending.
            #
            #    This is NOT specific to ``shield``/``wait_for``: a plain
            #    ``ensure_future(warmup_compile_async())`` scheduled at this
            #    same point is destroyed identically. Reproduced and verified
            #    under a real qasync loop in
            #    ``tests/unit/test_app_compile_warmup_qasync.py``.
            #
            # ``_run_async_task_when_loop_is_idle`` closes (2) by creating the
            # task only on a loop pass where no other task is mid-step, which
            # is exactly the condition ``_enter_task`` enforces. It is still

        **Why this exists.** Under qasync every ``call_soon`` is a Qt
        zero-timer, so a queued task step is delivered from ``timerEvent``
        during any Qt event processing — including a ``processEvents()`` call
        made *inside* another running task. ``asyncio._enter_task`` then raises
        ``RuntimeError: Cannot enter into task ... while another task ... is
        being executed``, the loop's exception handler swallows it, and the
        task is destroyed pending, having never run a line of its body. That is
        exactly how Story 20.3's first AC #1 fix failed in the shipped app: the
        warmup task was created after the preload and then killed during
        ``main.py``'s splash/UI stretch, so ``tts_compile_warmup_priming`` was
        never recorded on any launch.

        ``asyncio.current_task()`` reads the same ``_current_tasks`` slot that
        ``_enter_task`` checks, so testing it here is testing the precise
        precondition — not a proxy for it, and not a timing guess.

        Takes a **factory** rather than a coroutine object: a coroutine created
        eagerly and then deferred would emit a "never awaited" warning if the
        deferral is abandoned, and would be un-restartable.

        Deliberately separate from ``_run_async_task``. Every other caller of
        that method schedules from a Qt signal handler with no task on the
        stack, where the plain path is correct and has shipped for many
        releases; narrowing this change to the one startup hand-off that

        prompt. That ordering is **structural** here rather than enforced by a

        Handle user-initiated Stop click — cancel generation and/or
        stop playback, whichever is in flight.

        Story 11.4 follow-up wiring: the main window's Clear button
        doubles as a Stop button while either generation or playback
        is active. This handler fires both intents unconditionally:

          * ``QwenTTSService.cancel_generation()`` — propagates
            ``task.cancel()`` into the running asyncio task and posts
            the ``cancel`` + ``discard`` registry mutations (Story 11.4
            F1 fix). No-op when the service is idle.
          * ``AudioCoordinator.stop_all_playback()`` — stops every
            active monitor + virtual playback task. No-op when nothing
            is playing.

        Both calls are idempotent under "nothing to stop", so we do
        not need to disambiguate which state the UI was actually in.

        UI-flip note: cancel-during-generation flips back to idle via
        the ``_run_async_task`` ``on_error`` chain (CancelledError →
        ``_on_tts_generation_failed`` → ``set_generation_status(...,
        False)``). Cancel-during-playback has no analogous callback
        because ``stop_playback`` marks tasks as failed and the worker
        thread exits without firing ``_playback_complete_callback``.
        We therefore flip ``set_playback_active(False)`` synchronously
        here so the button reverts immediately on click; the async
        stops complete in the background.

          - We do NOT call ``tts_service.cancel_generation()``. Clear
            Comms interrupts *playback*, not *generation*. If the user
            is mid-generation, the in-flight ``GENERATING`` session
            keeps generating and will play after the Clear Comms clip
            finishes. This is intentional and load-bearing — a future
            reader must NOT "fix" the asymmetry.
          - We do NOT flip ``set_playback_active(False)`` /
            ``set_generation_status("Stopped", ...)`` on the window.
            The Clear Comms clip is about to play; the window state
            advances naturally as that dispatch fires.

        Safe to call when nothing is currently playing — the inner
        ``is None`` and ``state`` guards make every branch a defensive
        no-op (tested at TestClearCommsDispatch::test_idle_no_op).

            device session via ``start_streaming_session(sample_rate=...)``
            and inspects the returned ``{"monitor", "virtual"}`` dict; if
            BOTH services failed to open (real PyAudio error — the
            coordinator catches the exception internally and returns
            None values, audio_coordinator.py:1070-1072), the flag stays
            False so ``_play_generated_audio`` falls through to the batch
            path (NFR7-style graceful degradation).
          - chunks 1..N convert PCM float32 → int16 bytes and call
            ``play_audio_chunk(bytes, is_final=chunk.is_final)``.
            SENTENCE_STREAM emits its last data chunk with ``is_final=True``
            AND real audio in ``audio_data`` (qwen_tts_service.py:3071-3082);
            TRUE_STREAM emits a synthetic terminal chunk with
            ``audio_data.size == 0`` (qwen_tts_service.py:3929-3951). Both
            paths are handled by writing ``audio_data`` first when present
            and then closing the session on ``is_final``.

        The flag is intentionally NOT cleared on ``is_final`` — clearing
        here would race the dispatch path on the asyncio loop ordering.
        ``_play_generated_audio`` consumes (clears) it inside the dispatch
        skip-branch so the two paths are unambiguously sequenced.

        Cancel-vs-chunk race: ``epoch`` is captured at trampoline-schedule
        time; the cancel handler increments
        ``self._progressive_playback_epoch`` so any chunk queued before
        the cancel sees a mismatch under the lock and is dropped — this
        prevents a stale chunk from opening a fresh session after a
        cancel. ``epoch=None`` (legacy direct-test callers) skips the
        check.
