class _FirstChunkLatencyAggregator:
    """
    Derives ``_avg_first_chunk_latency`` from the metrics stream (Story 11.3).

    The architecture (P-9) mandates that running averages over telemetry
    aggregate from the metric stream, not from inline arithmetic at the call
    site. This aggregator subscribes to ``metrics.record(...)`` and updates
    the service's ``_avg_first_chunk_latency`` field whenever a
    ``first_chunk_latency_ms`` record fires.

    Note on units (AC #13): the metric is emitted in **milliseconds**
    (architecture's chosen unit) but ``_avg_first_chunk_latency`` is held in
    **seconds** for backward-compat with the public ``get_service_metrics()``
    surface (key ``"avg_first_chunk_latency"``). The aggregator divides by
    1000 before applying the running-average update.

    Note on the denominator (AC #15): ``_streaming_requests`` is incremented
    at request entry (``try:`` block at the top of the streaming generation
    path), not at successful completion. The aggregator reads the live
    counter from the service rather than maintaining its own — this
    preserves the pre-migration semantics ("requests attempted" not
    "requests completed") that the inline math relied on. Migrating the
    counter into the metric stream would shift increment timing on
    early-failure paths, which is a behavior change AC #18 forbids.

    Thread safety: ``__call__`` guards its read-then-write of
    ``_avg_first_chunk_latency`` with a per-aggregator ``threading.Lock``
    so two listener invocations cannot interleave their running-average
    update. The increment of ``_streaming_requests`` itself is NOT under
    this lock — it lives on the streaming generation path and is part of
    the service's pre-existing single-threaded streaming contract; the

        Fire-and-forget worker that runs ONCE per process startup. Decides
        between two paths based on ``compile_cache.is_warm(key)``:

          * Cache HIT — log the steady-state breadcrumb + emit a
            ``primed_warm`` telemetry record after running the SAME
            priming generation as the cold path, but WITHOUT calling
            ``compile_cache.mark_warm`` (the key is already warm).
            Story 20.2 / Epic 20 Follow-up A: the pre-20.2 behavior was to
            return early here and let the inductor cache reload lazily on
            the first user-facing generation. Story 20.1 §2.5 measured that
            lazy reload at ~3,961 ms of segment-1b (first-forward) time,
            billed to the user's FIRST utterance on EVERY launch after the
            first-ever. Priming on the warm path moves that cost into
            startup, where nobody is waiting on it. Set
            ``MYVOICE_DISABLE_WARM_COMPILE_PRIMING=1`` to restore the
            pre-20.2 early return exactly (telemetry then reads
            ``cache_hit`` as before).
          * Cache MISS — emit the "Preparing TTS engine…" indicator, run
            one short synthetic priming generation through the production
            dispatch chain (which exercises ``torch.compile``'s graph
            capture and writes the inductor cache to the per-key directory),
            then call ``compile_cache.mark_warm(key)`` on success and clear
            the indicator. On priming failure, the cache stays cold (next
            run retries) and a WARNING is logged.

        Gates (fast-exit; fail-closed):
          1. ``MYVOICE_DISABLE_COMPILE_WARMUP=1`` env var → skip entirely
             (test surface; CI envs that should not trigger compile).
          2. ``is_ampere_or_newer()`` False → skip (CPU / pre-Ampere hosts
             never engage compile per D-9 / NFR12).
          3. ``self._model_registry`` not wired → skip (no model means no
             compile state to prime).

        Story 20.2 AC #5 leaves every one of those fast-exits untouched;
        the warm-path change lives strictly *after* them, inside the
        ``is_warm(key) is True`` branch.

        Telemetry contract: ``metrics.record("tts_compile_warmup_priming",
        value, reason=..., duration_ms=...)``. The nine possible
        ``reason`` values mirror the engage path: ``"cache_hit"`` (skip —
        now emitted only when ``MYVOICE_DISABLE_WARM_COMPILE_PRIMING=1``
        restores the pre-20.2 warm-path early return),
        ``"primed_cold"`` (priming succeeded on a cold cache; ``mark_warm``
        called), ``"primed_warm"`` (Story 20.2 — priming succeeded on an
        already-warm cache; ``mark_warm`` deliberately NOT called),
        ``"priming_failed"``
        (priming raised), ``"cuda_unavailable"`` (D-9 skip),
        ``"pre_ampere"`` (D-9 skip), ``"user_disabled"`` (env-var skip),
        ``"no_model_registry"`` (precondition not met), and
        ``"no_model_loaded"`` (model not yet loaded; defer to first
        user-facing generation).

        Story 20.3 adds three more:
        ``"no_priming_prompt"`` (BASE is resident but the active profile has
        no cached ``voice_clone_prompt`` — priming SKIPS rather than switching
        models), ``"unsupported_priming_model"`` (no priming request shape for
        the resident model type), and ``"key_model_mismatch"`` (the cold
        path's ``mark_warm`` was vetoed because the cache key and the primed
        model disagreed — see ``_priming_matches_cache_key``).

        Story 20.3 also fixes *when* this runs. It is scheduled from
        ``app.py`` **after** the model preload completes (and after Story
        17.2's prompt hydration), because the pre-20.3 call site scheduled it
        before the first ``await`` of the same startup coroutine and it
        therefore hit ``no_model_loaded`` on every single launch — neither the
        cold nor the warm priming path had ever run in the shipped app.

        Never raises — every failure path lands in a WARNING log + a
        telemetry record. The fire-and-forget caller in ``app.py`` does
        not need a try/except wrapper (mirrors Story 17.2's
        ``hydrate_voice_clone_prompt_cache`` discipline).

        hard-coded CUSTOM_VOICE, so on a cloned-voice launch the cold path
        compiled one model and marked another model's key warm — permanently,

        Two independent checks, either of which vetoes the mark:

           the check that catches the real defect class end-to-end: priming a
           model other than the resident one goes through
           ``ensure_model_loaded``, which unloads and replaces the resident
           model, so the model_id resident *after* priming no longer matches
           the one the key was computed from.
        2. **The model type priming recorded as its target.** Skipped when
           ``_last_priming_model_type`` is None (a test that stubs the priming
           surface records no target); a recorded target that contradicts the
           key's model type is a mismatch.

        The model type is read from ``ModelRegistry.current_model_type``; it is
        never hard-coded. This is the story's central invariant, and it is
        structural rather than incidental: ``_dispatch_by_streaming_mode``
        ultimately calls ``ensure_model_loaded(request.model_type,
        checkpoint_path=...)``, and ``ModelRegistry`` keeps exactly one model
        resident, unloading the current one before loading another. A request
        whose ``model_type`` differs from the resident one therefore *evicts
        the user's model* — turning Epic 20's win into a multi-second loss on
        the user's first generation.

        ``checkpoint_path`` is carried across for the same reason: the
        registry's already-loaded fast path requires the checkpoint to match
        as well, so a fine-tuned resident model primed with
        ``checkpoint_path=None`` would be unloaded and reloaded. The raw value
        from ``current_checkpoint_path`` is passed through **unnormalised** —
        the dispatch chain hands it back to the registry as
        ``str(request.checkpoint_path)`` and the registry compares it by
        equality, so a ``Path`` round-trip (which rewrites separators on
        Windows) would silently defeat the match.

        Per resident model type:

        * **BASE** — the common startup state (cloned voice active, BASE
          resident). Primed with the active profile's cached
          ``voice_clone_prompt``, which exercises the same model *and* the
          same conditioning regime the user's first generation will take.
          Wrapped in a list per the qwen-tts library contract (a bare
          ``VoiceClonePromptItem`` is passed straight through and crashes on
          subscripting).
        * **CUSTOM_VOICE** — the canonical default speaker, exactly as
          Story 18.4 shipped.
        * **VOICE_DESIGN** — a synthetic instruct (see
          ``_COMPILE_PRIMING_VOICE_DESCRIPTION``). Both ``instruct`` and
          ``voice_description`` are set because the TRUE_STREAM dispatch reads
          ``request.instruct`` while the BATCH fallback reads
          ``request.voice_description``.

        check, indicator emission, and ``mark_warm`` logic stay independently
        testable (tests monkeypatch this method to succeed/fail without
        spinning up a real model or audio output).

        The priming dispatches a short text through the same three-mode
        dispatch fork the user-facing generators use, so the talker's first
        forward pass triggers ``torch.compile``'s graph capture and the
        inductor compile that PyTorch's per-key cache directory absorbs —
        and, on an already-warm cache (Story 20.2), the lazy inductor reload.

        **Story 20.3 — which model.** Pre-20.3 this method hard-coded
        ``QwenModelType.CUSTOM_VOICE`` while ``warmup_compile_async`` computed
        the compile-cache key from whichever model was *loaded*. On a
        cloned-voice launch (BASE resident) that primed one model and marked
        another model's key warm — and, once the startup ordering was fixed,
        would have evicted the user's model to do it.
        ``_build_compile_priming_request`` now reads the resident type from
        the registry, so the primed model, the cache key, and the model the
        user is about to generate with are the same model by construction.

        **Audio safety (Story 20.2 AC #2).** The request carries
        ``suppress_audio_output=True``, and every chunk-emit site resolves
        its consumer through ``_audio_chunk_sink(request)``, which returns
        ``None`` for such a request. The guarantee is therefore positive and
        request-scoped: it holds even when ``set_audio_chunk_ready_callback``
        has already wired a consumer before priming starts, and it does not
        touch a concurrent user-facing generation (whose own request is not
        suppressed). This matters more after Story 20.3 than before it: the
        BASE priming path carries the user's own cloned-voice prompt, so an
        unsuppressed prime would speak "Hello world." in the user's own voice.

        The architecture's D-23 acceptance: "warm = compile-priming
        generation completed without error". The caller's ``mark_warm``
        call lands on the cold path's success branch (the warm path does not

        """Story 16.8 — adapter wrapping the qwen-tts speech tokenizer's decode.

        Returned callable conforms to ``StreamingDecoderWorker``'s P-6
        contract: input is one chunk produced by the talker forward-hook
        (a ``torch.Tensor`` of shape ``(N_steps, num_code_groups)``); output
        is a float32 PCM sample array.

        Two Story-16.6 bugs uncovered and fixed in 16.8 against real
        qwen-tts 0.0.4 (RTX 5090, see Story 16.8 Change Log entry #5):

          1. ``model.speech_tokenizer`` does not exist — the speech
             tokenizer lives on the inner ``Qwen3TTSForConditionalGeneration``
             at ``model.model.speech_tokenizer`` (set during the inner
             wrapper's ``from_pretrained`` at modeling_qwen3_tts.py:1920).
          2. The 12Hz tokenizer's ``decode`` expects shape
             ``(batch_size, codes_length, num_quantizers)`` (see
             ``modeling_qwen3_tts_tokenizer_v2.py:1004``). Passing a flat
             tensor of single-codebook tokens silently misinterprets
             ``codes_length`` as ``num_quantizers``. The fix is to receive
             multi-codebook ``codec_ids`` from the forward-hook and wrap
             in a per-sample dict ``[{"audio_codes": chunk}]`` so the
             outer ``Qwen3TTSTokenizer.decode`` normalizer adds the batch
             dimension correctly.

        The trip-wire test at ``tests/test_qwen_tts_internals.py`` covers
        the ``Qwen3TTSTokenizerV1Model.decode`` symbol (Story 16.4 added
        it; Story 16.8 left it unchanged). Story 20.5 extends it to the
        12Hz V2 decoder module chain, which the state-cached path below
        walks directly.

        Story 20.5 Phase 2 (AC #3) — codec state caching
        ------------------------------------------------
        The adapter below decodes each chunk from a **cold codec state**:
        ``Qwen3TTSTokenizerV2CausalConvNet.forward`` left-pads with zeros
        where the previous chunk's real audio should be. Story 20.4
        measured the consequence (~35 % NRMSE at each chunk head, ±35
        samples of lag jitter, a deterministic 555-sample edge loss) and
        masked it with a 1,024-sample seam blend. Story 20.5 Phase 1
        proved on a bench that carrying the codec's real state removes the
        cause outright — edge loss to zero, head NRMSE to 0.6-0.8 %, lag
        jitter to 0 on every seam, at ≤ 2.52 MiB per session and no decode-
        time cost.

        So this builder now *prefers* the stateful decoder in
        ``services/tts_streaming/codec_state_cache.py`` and keeps the
        cold-state adapter below as the fallback. The preference is
        conditional on three build-time gates, all of which must pass:

          1. the operator kill switch ``MYVOICE_CODEC_STATE_CACHE`` is not
             set to a disabling value (this is also how the Phase 3
             audition generates its reference arm from one build);
          2. ``probe_decoder`` recognises every module in the loaded
             decoder graph and derives 1920 samples/frame with a
             555-sample edge loss, matching the two measured constants in
             ``streaming_decoder.py``;
          3. a one-shot numerical self-test on the *loaded weights* agrees
             with ``decoder.forward`` (memoised on the decoder object, so
             in the shipping configuration the compile-priming generation
             at startup pays for it and no user generation does).

        Any failure logs the reason and returns the stateless adapter, so
        the worst case is today's audio, never wrong audio. That asymmetry
        is deliberate: this wrapper re-walks upstream internals, and a
        silent desync there would present as "the codec got worse" rather
        than as a bug.

        Replaces Story 16.6's literal ``model.model.generate(streamer=streamer)``
        wire-up — which Story 16.7 §3.1 measured as silently broken (50/50
        utterances on the maintainer's RTX 5090 produced empty chunks
        because the call passed no conditioning args) — with a patch-based
        approach that reaches the canonical Path A target
        (``self.talker.generate(inputs_embeds=..., streamer=streamer, ...)``)
        without replicating the wrapper's ~250 lines of preprocessing.

        Why a talker-patch rather than full preprocessing replication. The
        Story 16.8 Dev Notes describe two paths:

          - Path B: rely on the wrapper's ``**kwargs`` to forward
            ``streamer`` through to the inner ``self.talker.generate``.
            Source-read of ``modeling_qwen3_tts.py:2042-2278`` and the
            ``probe_qwen_tts_streamer.py`` empirical run both confirm the
            wrapper drops ``streamer`` before reaching the inner call — Path
            B is structurally broken at qwen-tts 0.0.4.
          - Path A (literal "replicate preprocessing"): hand-roll the input
            embedding tower (~150-250 lines of codec prefill, language
            token resolution, speaker embedding construction, role prefix,
            attention mask, trailing-text-hidden, batch left-padding).
            Brittle to upstream qwen-tts changes; large maintenance
            surface; duplicate of the wrapper's body.

        The talker-patch variant lands the same destination as literal
        Path A — ``self.talker.generate(streamer=streamer, ...)`` is
        invoked with the wrapper's correctly-constructed ``inputs_embeds``,
        ``attention_mask``, ``trailing_text_hidden``, and ``tts_pad_embed`` —
        but *does not* duplicate the preprocessing in MyVoice. The trade-off:
        it depends on the wrapper calling ``self.talker.generate(...)``
        exactly once during ``model.generate_*(...)``, which the trip-wire
        extension (``tests/test_qwen_tts_internals.py``) pins via attribute
        and call-site assertions so a future qwen-tts version that fans out
        to a different talker entrypoint will fail CI before silently
        regressing streaming.

        Concurrency: the patch is installed on the shared
        ``model.model.talker`` instance for the duration of one
        ``model.generate_*(...)`` call. Story 16.6's session-registry P-7
        invariant (one in-flight TRUE_STREAM dispatch per service instance)
        ensures the patch is single-threaded with respect to itself; the
        outer ``try/finally`` restores the bound method on every exit
        (success, exception, sentinel).

        Cancellation invariant (D-11): the talker thread MUST NOT raise on
        cancel. The patch is transparent to HF GenerationMixin's
        cancellation flow — when ``streamer._cancel_event`` flips,
        ``streamer.put`` becomes a no-op, HF iterates a few more times
        producing tokens we drop, then completes cleanly and calls
        ``streamer.end()``. No exceptions raised through HF internals;
        CUDA state stays clean.

        Short-circuit sentinel: HF's ``GenerationMixin.generate`` calls
        ``streamer.end()`` when token generation completes; the wrapper
        then runs a residual non-streaming ``speech_tokenizer.decode`` to
        build the full waveform return tuple. Since the streaming worker
        has already decoded chunk-by-chunk, that residual decode is
        wasted GPU compute. Raising ``_TalkerStreamComplete`` from the
        injecting wrapper short-circuits past it, saving ~the same time
        as one non-streaming generation per dispatch.

        - 16.3 ``CodecTokenStreamer`` is the producer plug-compatible with
          HF's ``BaseStreamer``; the talker thread runs
          ``model.model.generate(streamer=streamer)``
        - 16.4 ``StreamingDecoderWorker`` is the consumer; it pulls from the
          streamer's queue, decodes via ``decode_fn``, and posts
          ``('append_chunk', sid, pcm)`` and ``('finalize', sid)`` to the
          registry through the ``post_mutation`` callable
        - 16.5 ``register_cancel_hook`` + ``request_cancel`` flip

          ``audio_coordinator.cancel_playback(sid)`` on user-cancel; the

             devices. TRUE_STREAM calls this directly with the assembled first
             chunk; it is the user's speakers and it never consulted the sink.
          3. ``_save_audio_to_cache`` — writes ``myvoice_current.wav``, which
             ``get_cached_audio_path()`` hands to Replay Last. An unguarded
             priming write leaves "Hello world." as the replay target on every
             launch. Because ``_generation_complete_callback`` is guarded on a
             truthy ``audio_file``, skipping the write also closes that channel.
          4. ``SessionRegistry.create_session`` — a registered session becomes
             ``_saveable`` / ``_focal``, which lights the Save button at startup
             and can demote the user's real generation to
             ``_previous_saveable``.

        ``getattr`` with a default keeps the predicate safe for the duck-typed
        request objects some older tests hand to the dispatch paths. It fails
        OPEN by design (an unrecognised request is treated as user-facing);
        silencing a real user is the worse failure. ``_run_compile_priming``
        asserts the predicate on its own request before dispatch so a rename
        fails loudly rather than silently un-suppressing priming.
