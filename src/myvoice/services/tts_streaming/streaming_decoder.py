"""StreamingDecoderWorker — single-thread-per-session decoder for TRUE_STREAM TTS.

Story 16.4 — Phase ⊥ of D-20 (architecture-optimization-pass.md).

Architecture references:
  - P-6 (lines 431-441): four-step decoder contract — pull token chunks
    from streamer.queue.get(), decode with overlap-add (chunk+lookahead,
    trim trailing lookahead-portion), post each PCM segment via
    post_mutation('append_chunk', session_id, pcm), post finalize on
    END_OF_STREAM, drain-and-post-cancel on _cancel_event.is_set().
    Forbidden: write to disk, emit signals, touch audio devices.
  - P-7 (lines 443-451): cancellation propagation — drain on cancel;
    no exception raised through HF / CUDA back into the streamer.
  - D-11 (line 261): cooperative cancel via threading.Event shared with
    the streamer (single event; both producer and consumer observe).
  - P-9 (lines 463-476): per-chunk decode latency metric; the worker
    is the architecturally-named owner of decode_chunk_latency_ms.
  - Import rule (line 674): may import tts_streaming.codec_token_streamer,
    qwen_tts internals (NOT exercised here — see Story 16.6),
    numpy, threading, observability.metrics. May NOT import
    myvoice.services.sessions (posts via callback supplied at init).
    Review-fix deviation: also imports `queue` (stdlib) so drain can
    catch `queue.Empty` narrowly instead of bare-Except'ing — same
    stdlib tier as `threading` / `time`.

Public surface (consumed by Stories 16.5, 16.6):
  - StreamingDecoderWorker: thread-owning decoder worker class.

Overlap-add interpretation: future-lookahead. Each non-final chunk
decodes (chunk_size + lookahead) tokens; the worker posts only the
leading chunk_size's worth of PCM samples. The final residual
chunk (length < chunk_size + lookahead) is posted whole — there is
no following chunk to overlap with.

Story 20.4 — the overlap is now actually ADDED
----------------------------------------------
Through Story 20.3 the "overlap-add" was an overlap-*discard*: the
trailing lookahead's worth of PCM was thrown away and the next chunk's
independent decode of the same tokens was butt-spliced on. Story 20.4's
failed NFR3 audition traced two distinct defects to that splice, both
measured against captured pcm_full (see
``_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/20-4-seam-analysis.py``):

1. **A splice-alignment bug.** ``decode(N frames)`` returns exactly
   ``1920 * N - 555`` samples — 1920 samples per codec frame plus a
   FIXED 555-sample convolution edge loss. The trim was computed as
   ``round(lookahead * len(pcm_full) / len(chunk))``, which treats that
   fixed loss as if it were proportional, so every posted chunk fell
   short by ``555 * chunk_size / (chunk_size + lookahead)`` samples:
   370 at chunk_size=10, 463 at 25. Cross-correlating consecutive
   pcm_full arrays puts the true splice point at exactly
   ``chunk_size * 1920``, so those samples were real speech — measured
   RMS at or above the utterance's own — silently deleted at every
   chunk boundary. This shipped from Story 16.4 onward and is why the
   round-1 audition flagged long-form seams at chunk_size=25 too.

2. **A codec-state mismatch.** The two decodes of the shared lookahead
   frames differ by ~35 % NRMSE (correlation ~0.93) because each decode
   starts from a cold codec state. Alignment cannot fix that; correcting
   the trim ALONE measurably makes the click worse (seam step 8.5x ->
   18.0x the non-seam baseline at chunk_size=25), because it butts two
   genuinely different waveforms together at the same instant.

The fix pairs them. The tail this module used to discard is exactly the
audio the next chunk re-decodes at its head, so it is now retained and
cross-faded into that head over ``_OVERLAP_ADD_SAMPLES``. Unlike widening
the CONSUMER crossfade in ``streaming_chunk_buffer.py``, this consumes no
audio and no duration: both sides of the blend are the same moment in
time. Measured effect, seam step as a multiple of the non-seam baseline:

    chunk_size=25   shipped 8.46x  ->  aligned+OLA 1.25x
    chunk_size=10   shipped 13.06x ->  aligned+OLA 0.85x

Both land at the baseline on that metric. **That metric later turned out
not to predict audibility** (Story 20.4 evidence SS13.1: two independent
offline seam metrics failed to reproduce the listener's calls on 21 judged
files, most likely for want of an auditory-masking model). What actually
certifies this code is a round-3 A/B audition at chunk_size=25 with the
geometry held fixed and only the stitching varied: the fix was cleaner on
both long fixtures, never worse on any, preferred 2-0. chunk_size=10 was
attempted by the same story and REVERTED - at 2.5x the seam density the
blend's own harm overtakes the alignment gain (SS13.2/SS13.3, SS15.1).

A known residual, not masked: the blend fades into the next chunk's
cold-start region, where the decode error is 0.5-1.4x local RMS and the two
copies correlate at only ~0.55 (not the ~0.93 measured over a wider window).
At chunk_size=25 the alignment gain dominates that and the net is positive.
Better-shaped remedies - blending after the next chunk settles, or caching
codec state across chunks - are recorded in the evidence SS13.6/SS11.9 and
are not implemented here.

This does NOT make the codec carry state across chunks — the reference
implementations do that and we still do not (see the Story 20.4 evidence
file, §11). It masks the consequence at the boundary rather than removing
the cause.

Story 20.5 — the cause is now removed, and this blend is inert
--------------------------------------------------------------
``services/tts_streaming/codec_state_cache.py`` carries the codec's real
state across the boundary, so on the state-cached path the two paragraphs
above describe a defect that no longer exists. The worker learns which regime
it is in from ``decode_fn.carries_codec_state`` and switches its geometry
model accordingly:

    stateless (pre-20.5, and still the fallback)
        every decode returns ``1920*N - 555``; splice at ``chunk_size*1920``
    state-cached
        the FIRST decode of a session returns ``1920*N - 555`` and every later
        one returns exactly ``1920*N`` — the 555 moves to the stream-start
        call rather than shrinking — so the first splice is
        ``chunk_size*1920 - 555`` and every later one is ``chunk_size*1920``

The overlap-add below is deliberately left running on both paths. Under
carried state the tail this chunk retains was decoded from the *same state
snapshot* the next chunk resumes from, so the blend mixes a signal with a
numerically identical copy of itself: an identity operation, measured at
0 samples of difference on the CPU reference model
(``test_overlap_add_is_an_identity_under_carried_state``) rather than
assumed. AC #3 asks for the Story 20.4 seam fix to be re-evaluated on
evidence and not merely assumed away; leaving it in place and proving it
inert is what keeps Story 20.5 Phase 2 to a single variable. Removing it —
and the 64-sample consumer crossfade in ``streaming_chunk_buffer.py``, which
under carried state blends genuinely *different* moments and is therefore
mildly harmful rather than merely useless — is a follow-up with its own
audition, not a rider on this one.

State lifecycle (AC #3): ``decode_fn.reset()`` is called on session start, on
cancel, and on completion. It is strictly per-session — the decode_fn is
built per dispatch and owns its own state object — so concurrent generations
never share codec state.

Story 20.6 — the lookahead is retired, and this file did not change
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Carried state IS the priming the 5-frame future lookahead existed to
re-establish, so on the state-carrying path the dispatch layer now sets
``streamer.lookahead = 0`` (``CodecTokenStreamer.apply_codec_state_geometry``,
driven by the same ``decode_fn.carries_codec_state`` declaration this worker
reads). No code below moved, because the arithmetic already degenerates
correctly and *says so*:

  * ``is_full_window`` requires ``self._lookahead > 0``, so with the lookahead
    retired it is False for every chunk. The splice/trim branch is never
    entered and ``pcm_segment = pcm_full`` — **the worker posts the whole
    decode, untrimmed**, which is exactly right: with no overlap there is
    nothing to trim.
  * ``next_overlap`` is therefore never set, so ``_pending_overlap`` stays
    ``None`` and ``_apply_overlap_add`` returns its input. **The Story 20.4
    seam blend is removed by construction, not by a second decision.** It
    cross-fades a retained lookahead tail into the next chunk's head; with no
    lookahead there is no tail. Story 20.5 had already measured it as inert
    under carried state — the two sides of the blend were bit-identical — so
    nothing audible is given up here either.
  * ``_codec_state_frames += n_frames``, which still mirrors
    ``StatefulCodecDecoder.__call__``'s own commit rule exactly: built with
    ``window_frames == commit_frames`` it likewise commits ``n_frames`` on
    every chunk, and its two-pass snapshot/restore collapses to a single pass.
  * the length identity is unaffected — the first decode of a session still
    pays the 555-sample edge loss and every later one returns exactly
    ``1920*N`` — so ``geometry_ok`` and the ``decode_geometry_unverified``
    trip-wire keep working at the new window.

The STATELESS path keeps ``lookahead = 5`` and therefore keeps every branch
below: independent renderings of overlapping token spans are still all it
produces, and the trim plus the blend are the only seam handling it has.
