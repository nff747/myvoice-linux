"""
Qt-main-thread singleton that mediates all generation-session mutations.

Story 11.2 — Phase 1 of D-20 (architecture-optimization-pass.md). Net-zero
behavior change: this story creates the registry plus tests; no existing
module imports it yet (Story 11.4 wires it into `qwen_tts_service`).

Responsibilities (per architecture):
  * Owns the in-flight `GenerationSession` collection (`_sessions`).
  * Mediates every state mutation through Qt-thread-affined slot methods.
  * Provides `post_mutation()` for cross-thread (worker → main) dispatch.
  * Emits `session_state_changed` and `current_session_changed`. The
    `playback_queue_depth_changed` signal is declared as an inert port for
    Story 13.1 to wire later. The `saveable_session_changed` signal is wired
    by Story 14.1 (this story) — see Saveable Slot Lifecycle Contract below.
  * Computes `focal_session_id` from session lifecycle state with the
    four-tier priority defined in validation gap #1.

Design notes that future readers (especially Story 11.4) MUST know:

  * `mark_audible` is a substate flip, not a transition. The registry still
    re-emits `session_state_changed(id, current_state)` so subscribers (the
    Story 12.1 indicator) can re-read both `state` and `is_audible` from
    `registry.get(session_id)`. This is the chosen substate-observation
    pattern (D-15); a fifth signal was rejected to keep the D-13 contract
    at four signals.

  * `start_generation` is an explicit mutation rather than auto-promoting
    on the first `append_chunk`. Story 11.4 needs to fire
    `session_state_changed(GENERATING)` and the legacy `generation_started`
    signal at the same moment — explicit transition makes that wiring
    obvious and keeps `append_chunk` semantically pure (data-only).

  * The registry is the *sole* signal emitter for session state (P-2). The
    underlying `GenerationSession` is signal-free (Story 11.1) and never
    crosses a signal boundary as a payload (P-4).

  * `model_type` is accepted by `create_session` (validation gap #5) but
    `GenerationSession` does not currently carry it. The registry stores
    it in a parallel `_session_model_types` mapping until Story 11.4
    decides whether to migrate the field into the session itself.

Focal Session Contract (Story 12.2 lock-down)
=============================================

  * **Four-tier priority** (validation gap #1 / `focal_session_id`):
      (a) most recently transitioned PLAYING session;
      (b) else most recently transitioned GENERATING/READY_TO_PLAY session;
      (c) else most recently transitioned terminal (DONE/CANCELLED/ERROR)
          session within ``_FOCAL_DECAY_SECONDS`` of now;
      (d) else None.
    Tier-(b) MUST skip terminal-within-decay candidates even when those are
    more recent. PENDING is not focal-eligible at any tier.

  * **Inclusive decay boundary**: tier-(c)'s comparison is
    ``(now - s._last_transition_at) <= _FOCAL_DECAY_SECONDS`` — a terminal
    session at exactly ``_FOCAL_DECAY_SECONDS`` ago is still focal.

  * **Time source**: ``GenerationSession._last_transition_at`` and the
    registry's ``now`` both come from ``time.perf_counter()``. Rationale
    is tie-avoidance under tight time clustering; on Python 3.10 + Windows,
    both ``time.time()`` and ``time.monotonic()`` use ``GetTickCount64``
    with ~15.625 ms resolution, which ties under back-to-back transitions
    in the same Qt event tick. ``perf_counter`` uses
    ``QueryPerformanceCounter`` (sub-microsecond) and is documented
    monotonic on this platform (see ``time.get_clock_info('perf_counter')``).
    AC #4 of Story 12.2 specifies ``time.monotonic()`` literally; the
    deviation is necessary for Python 3.10 and is documented in that
    story's Change Log. Python 3.13+ aligns ``time.monotonic`` with QPC
    on Windows, so a future runtime upgrade may revisit this.

  * **No spurious emissions**: ``current_session_changed`` fires exactly
    when the recomputed focal id differs from ``_last_focal_id``. State-
    preserving mutations (``append_chunk``, idempotent ``set_error``, the
    ``mark_audible`` substate flip) and tier-internal transitions
    (``GENERATING`` → ``READY_TO_PLAY`` is tier-(b) → tier-(b)) do NOT
    emit. The asymmetry vs ``session_state_changed``'s D-15 substate
    re-emit is intentional and load-bearing for the indicator's redraw
    suppression (Story 12.1).

  * **No eager emit on construct**: ``__init__`` does not fire
    ``current_session_changed``. ``_last_focal_id`` starts at ``None``;
    a subscriber attached immediately after construction observes only
    the registry's first real focal change. This pins the contract so a
    future "synthetic initialization frame" optimization is rejected.

  * Cross-references: see
    ``tests/unit/services/sessions/test_session_registry.py``,
    classes ``TestFocalPriorityExplicit`` and
    ``TestCurrentSessionChangedContract``.

Saveable Slot Lifecycle Contract (Story 14.1 lock-down)
========================================================

  * **Two slots, never more** (D-3, D-4): the registry holds at most two
    ``SaveableAudio`` records — ``_saveable`` (the most recently finalized
    GENERATED session, drives ``saveable_session_id`` and Save button
    enablement) and ``_previous_saveable`` (the prior saveable, lingering
    in grace-period memory so its buffer is preserved). Slot capture happens
    at ``finalize`` time; the dataclass holds a strong reference to
    ``complete_audio`` so the buffer survives the originating session's
    later ``discard()`` (which sets ``session.complete_audio = None`` per
    ``generation_session.py:197``).

  * **Promotion on finalize** (D-3, AC #2/#3/#4): on every
    ``finalize(session_id)`` for a GENERATED-source session, the prior
    ``_saveable`` demotes to ``_previous_saveable`` (overwriting and
    releasing whatever was there), the new session's snapshot becomes the
    current ``_saveable``, and ``saveable_session_changed.emit(session_id)``
    fires exactly once.

  * **Release on next mark_done** (D-4, AC #5): when the current saveable
    reaches DONE (its ``mark_done`` slot fires), ``_previous_saveable`` is
    cleared (set to ``None``); ``_saveable`` is unchanged;
    ``saveable_session_changed`` does NOT fire (the saveable_session_id is
    unchanged). Idempotent if ``_previous_saveable`` is already ``None``.

  * **Invalidation on cancel / set_error** (P-7, AC #7 + review fix): a
    GENERATED session reaching ``CANCELLED`` or ``ERROR`` must vacate
    whichever slot it occupies, so neither slot ever references a
    non-successful session. Two cases:
      - Session is the current ``_saveable`` → revert: ``_saveable`` becomes
        ``_previous_saveable`` (or ``None``), ``_previous_saveable``
        clears, and ``saveable_session_changed.emit(<new_id_or_None>)``
        fires exactly once.
      - Session is the ``_previous_saveable`` → clear: ``_previous_saveable``
        becomes ``None``; ``_saveable`` is unchanged and no signal fires
        (saveable_session_id is unchanged).
    If the session is in neither slot, both slots are unchanged and no
    signal fires (silent no-op — mirrors
    ``_recompute_focal_and_maybe_emit``'s no-spurious-emission discipline).
    The architecture's P-7 "Cancelled sessions never become saveable" is
    enforced by the invariant that no slot ever holds a CANCELLED/ERROR
    session — this is what makes the revert path safe to promote
    ``_previous_saveable`` without re-checking its state.

  * **PRELOADED exclusion** (D-5, AC #6): sessions with
    ``source == SessionSource.PRELOADED`` (Clear Comms playback clones,
    Epic 15 territory) NEVER participate in saveable lifecycle. Promotion,
    release, and revert paths all gate on
    ``session.source == SessionSource.GENERATED``.

  * **Discard does NOT modify slots** (AC #8): the ``discard`` slot drops
    the session record from ``_sessions`` but leaves ``_saveable`` and
    ``_previous_saveable`` untouched. Slot lifecycle is driven by
    ``mark_done`` (release) and ``cancel`` (revert), not by ``discard``.

  * **Emission ordering on finalize** (AC #2): the three signals fire in
    this fixed order — ``session_state_changed(id, READY_TO_PLAY)`` then
    ``current_session_changed(id)`` (if focal changed) then
    ``saveable_session_changed(id)``. DirectConnection subscribers observe
    them in this order; QueuedConnection subscribers see them queued in
    this order.

    ``tests/unit/services/sessions/test_session_registry.py``,
    classes ``TestSaveableSlotPromotion``, ``TestSaveableSlotDemotion``,

Cooperative Cancellation Chain Contract (Story 16.5 lock-down)
==============================================================

  * **Two-endpoint API split** (P-7, architecture-optimization-pass.md:443-451):
    cancellation flows in one direction —
    ``user → registry → streamer's _cancel_event → talker .generate()
    returns → decoder drains → session transitions CANCELLED → DISCARDED``.
    The registry exposes two endpoints that map to the two halves of this
    chain:

      - ``request_cancel(session_id)`` — synchronous, runs on the calling
        thread, fires the registered cancel hook (if any). The hook
        flips ``streamer._cancel_event`` and asks the audio coordinator to
        stop playback for the session. **Does NOT transition session
        state** — that's the decoder worker's job (it posts
        ``('cancel', sid)`` via ``post_mutation`` after draining its queue;
        the existing ``cancel`` slot then runs on Qt main thread and does
        the actual ``session.cancel()``).
      - The existing ``cancel(session_id)`` slot — Qt-main-thread only,
        transitions state via ``session.cancel()``, emits
        ``session_state_changed``, invokes saveable-slot invalidation
        (Story 14.1), auto-clears the cancel hook (Story 16.5).

    The split exists so the architecture's P-7 invariant — "session.cancel()
    sets the event; it does not immediately transition state. The decoder
    worker's drain-on-cancel posts the actual CANCELLED transition (so we
    never have a 'cancelled but still emitting chunks' window)" — is
    honored verbatim. **Do NOT** extend ``request_cancel`` to also call
    ``session.cancel()`` directly; that would re-introduce the
    "cancelled but still emitting" window.

  * **Hook lifecycle**: Story 16.6's TRUE_STREAM dispatcher registers a
    hook at session-create time via ``register_cancel_hook(sid, fn)``;
    re-registration replaces the prior hook silently (so the dispatcher
    can re-construct the streamer + worker pair across retries within a
    single session_id without leaking stale hooks). The hook is
    auto-cleared by ``_maybe_clear_cancel_hook(sid)`` at the bottom of
    every terminal-state slot — ``cancel``, ``mark_done``, ``set_error``,
    ``discard``. Cleanup is idempotent (``dict.pop(sid, None)``); the
    redundant ``discard`` call provides defense-in-depth in case a future
    code path adds an unobserved terminal transition.

  * **Race tolerance**: ``register_cancel_hook`` does NOT require the
    session_id to be present in ``_sessions`` — Story 16.6's wiring may
    happen in a slightly different tick from ``create_session``. A hook
    registered for a never-existing session lives until the registry is
    GC'd, but that path is not reachable under normal flow (registry
    callers always create the session first).

  * **Defensive but quiet**: ``request_cancel`` for an unregistered
    session_id is a quiet no-op (no exception, no metric, no WARN-log).
    Today's batch + sentence-stream callers in
    ``QwenTTSService.cancel_generation`` invoke this unconditionally for
    every session, and those flows correctly carry no hook. A hook that
    raises is caught and recorded as a ``cancel_hook_error`` metric (per
    Story 16.4's ``decode_error`` precedent — numeric value 1.0, error
    repr in tags); ``request_cancel`` returns normally and the hook is
    NOT auto-cleared on exception (Story 16.6's wiring may want to retry
    against the same surface in failure-recovery scenarios).

  * **Cross-thread invocation**: ``request_cancel`` runs on the calling
    thread synchronously — it does NOT hop to the Qt main thread. The
    hook's job is to flip a thread-safe ``threading.Event`` and schedule
    an async coroutine on the audio coordinator's event loop; both are
    thread-safe operations and forcing a Qt-main hop would introduce
    latency that violates the P-7 100ms cancel-chain target.

  * **Module boundary preserved**: the new code adds at most one
    ``Callable`` import from ``typing``; it does NOT import
    ``myvoice.services.tts_streaming.*`` or
    ``myvoice.services.audio_coordinator`` (architecture line 662). The
    cancel-hook callable carries any tts_streaming / audio_coordinator
    reference indirectly via its closure (Story 16.6's wiring composes
    the closure).

  * Cross-references: see
    ``tests/unit/services/sessions/test_session_registry.py``,
    classes ``TestCancelHookRegistration``, ``TestRequestCancelInvocation``.

        Behaves identically to `set_error` for active sessions (PENDING,
        GENERATING, READY_TO_PLAY, PLAYING) but silently absorbs sessions
        that have already settled into any terminal state — ERROR,
        CANCELLED, DONE, or DISCARDED. The strict `set_error` contract is
        preserved separately (see `test_set_error_propagates_from_other_terminals`).

        Why this exists: when TRUE_STREAM raises mid-dispatch
        (`qwen_tts_service._generate_true_stream`'s 0-chunks-on-cold-compile
        path), the cleanup posts `cancel_event.set()` → joins the worker,
        which in turn posts ('cancel', sid) per the worker's drain-on-cancel
        contract. By the time the dispatch's own ('set_error', sid) reaches
        the Qt event loop, the session is already CANCELLED — and strict
        `set_error` raises InvalidSessionStateError, which the global
        exception handler surfaces as an "Unexpected Error" dialog. The
        fallback chain has already succeeded by then, so the dialog is
        purely cosmetic noise. `try_set_error` absorbs the race.

        Side effects (saveable slot invalidation, cancel hook cleanup) are
        unchanged from `set_error`'s contract — they only run when an
        actual transition occurs. Terminal-state absorption is a true
