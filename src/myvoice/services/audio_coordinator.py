Audio Coordinator Service

This module provides the AudioCoordinator that manages both MonitorAudioService
and VirtualMicrophoneService for coordinated dual-stream audio routing without
resource conflicts.

This replaces the problematic play_synchronized_dual_stream approach with proper
service separation as specified in the dual-service architecture design.

Story 2.5: Audio Device Resilience
- Integrated DeviceResilienceManager for graceful device disconnect/reconnect handling
- Auto-recovery when devices reconnect
- User notifications for device changes

Microphone Mixing Integration:
- MicrophoneCaptureService for real-time mic input capture
- AudioMixerService for mixing mic + TTS audio streams
- Mixed audio routing to virtual microphone for Discord/Zoom/Teams
- Volume controls and mute functionality for mic input

# Defaults for the streaming consumer-side smoothing layer (RTX 3060 +
# 0.6B small tier surfaced underrun-induced silences and chunk-boundary
# clicks 2026-05-12). Watermark is the symmetric start-of-stream fix to
# Story 18.3's end-of-stream drain. Crossfade of 64 samples ≈ 2.7 ms at
# 24 kHz — small enough to be imperceptible, large enough to mask DC
# discontinuity at chunk boundaries.

_DEFAULT_STREAMING_CROSSFADE_SAMPLES = 64

# Adaptive pre-buffer mode tuning. Activated for slow-producer hardware
# (RTX 3060 / <16GB VRAM) where the static 500ms watermark cannot mask
# inter-chunk gaps that grow as the generation continues. The formula
# τ_gapless = T_a × (1/P − 1) computes the cushion needed to finish
# playback by gen_complete; on fast hardware (P ≥ 1) it collapses to 0 so
# this code path is a no-op there. Story 20.4 made the buffer decide
# whether that cushion is worth buying (see CUSHION_BUDGET_SECONDS
# below) rather than chasing it up to the 10 s guardrail. See
# `streaming_chunk_buffer.py` module docstring for the math and the
# product trade.
#
# T_a ESTIMATOR (Story 20.4 AC #2, recalibrated) — T_a is estimated from
# the character count before generation starts, and feeds tau_min directly.
#
# The 2026-05-15 estimator was a single proportional constant,
# CHARS_TO_AUDIO_SECONDS = 0.08 s/char, calibrated from ONE 19-char 3060
# smoke utterance. Story 20.1 §2.7 measured it against the canonical
# fixtures and found it ~44 % high on long-form: 349 chars → 27.92 s
# estimated against 19.32 s measured. Overshoot inflates tau_min, which
# is exactly the wrong direction for an interjection feature.
#
# Two measured points are now available, and they do not sit on a line
# through the origin — short utterances carry proportionally more
# non-speech time (onset silence, the reference padding, final decay):
#
#     349 chars → 19.32 s  (Story 20.1 long fixture, measured)
#      33 chars →  2.30 s  (Story 20.1 short / Clear Comms fixture)
#
# An affine fit T_a ≈ INTERCEPT + chars × SECONDS_PER_CHAR through those
# two points gives 0.523 s + 0.0539 s/char. Rounded to 0.5 + 0.055 the
# estimator stays very slightly conservative (over-estimating) on both:
#
#     349 chars → 19.70 s  (+2.0 % vs measured, was +44.5 %)
#      33 chars →  2.32 s  (+0.7 % vs measured, was +14.8 %)
#
# TWO POINTS IS A THIN CALIBRATION and it is deliberately biased slightly
# high rather than centred. It is also now much less load-bearing than it
# was: under the Story 20.4 two-regime policy T_a only changes behaviour
# inside the FEASIBLE band (tau_gapless ≤ cushion budget); once
# gaplessness is out of reach the buffer falls back to the static
# watermark and T_a drops out of the decision entirely. Story 20.1 §2.7
# had already shown the old estimator changed nothing at the 3060's
# documented P ≈ 0.5 because the cap dominated there.
#
# CUSHION_BUDGET_SECONDS = 2.0 — the most first-audio latency we will
# spend chasing gaplessness on a slow host. Four times the static
# watermark (0.5 s), and set against the RTX 5090's ~1.35 s total TTFA
# (Story 20.3 §4.1) as the reference for what "fast" feels like. Past
# this the cushion cannot be bought inside an interjection-shaped latency
# budget, so `StreamingChunkBuffer` stops paying for it. See that class's
# module docstring for the full trade.
#
# MAX_PRE_DELAY_SECONDS = 10.0 — UNCHANGED, and deliberately so. It is a
# safety bound against unbounded waits (cold compile, CPU-only), not a
# tuning knob; Story 20.4 explicitly does not move it. Under the
# two-regime policy it should no longer be the binding escape on real
# hardware.
#
# LOW_VRAM_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 16 GiB — matches the existing tier auto-
# default in `hardware_probe.detect_recommended_tier`. RTX 30xx Ampere
# line ≤ 12 GiB triggers adaptive mode; RTX 3090 / 4080+ / 5090 stay
# on the static-watermark fast path.

            channels: Number of audio channels

            text_length: Optional character count of the input text. When
                provided AND the primary CUDA device reports < 16 GiB VRAM,
                the consumer-side buffer enables adaptive pre-buffer mode:
                playback start is delayed until enough audio is buffered
                to bridge the producer-side deficit — but only while that
                cushion fits inside CUSHION_BUDGET_SECONDS. Past that,
                Story 20.4's policy declares gaplessness unreachable and
                falls back to the static watermark rather than spending
                latency it cannot convert into gaplessness. See
                module-level docstring on `streaming_chunk_buffer.py` for
                the τ_gapless = T_a × (1/P − 1) math and the trade. When
                None or VRAM ≥ 16 GiB, the buffer uses the static 500 ms
                watermark and none of this applies.
            session_id: Optional registry-issued session id, threaded from
                the progressive-playback consumer purely so the Story 20.1
                ``ttfa_first_playback_write_ms`` boundary metric carries the
                same session tag the producer-side TTFA boundaries do, and
                the Story 18.1 CSV joins without a positional heuristic.
                **Observational only — no behavior reads it.** Defaults to
                None, which every pre-existing caller supplies implicitly.
                Re-armed on every ``start_streaming_session`` and cleared on
                ``stop_streaming_session`` so a multi-generation playback
                session emits the boundary once per session rather than once
                per process.
            crossfade_samples: Width of the consumer-side chunk-boundary
                cross-fade, in samples. ``None`` (every pre-existing caller)
                keeps the 64-sample default.

                Story 20.5 added this because the cross-fade's premise is
                that consecutive chunks are *independent renderings butt-
                spliced together*, so a short dissolve hides the step. It
                blends the last K samples of one chunk with the first K of
                the next — DIFFERENT moments in time — so when that premise
                is false and the chunks are already one continuous waveform,
                it is not a repair: it is a 2.7 ms comb over audio that
                needed none. With codec state caching active on TRUE_STREAM
                the premise is false, and the Story 20.5 Phase 3 audition
                flagged the unmasked comb as a blocking defect on two
                single-seam trials. Measured against the codec's true output,
                the cross-fade made that stream 2.6-3.3x worse
                (``20-5-phase2-evidence.md`` SS4.2).

                Pass 0 only when the producer guarantees its chunks are
                sample-continuous. SENTENCE_STREAM butt-splices independently
                generated sentences and its discontinuities are real, so it
                keeps the default — Story 20.5 measured nothing on that path
                and deliberately did not change it.

        Monitor and virtual writes run CONCURRENTLY via asyncio.gather. On
        MME / DirectSound host APIs, PyAudio's blocking `stream.write` stalls
        until the device-internal buffer can accept the data — effectively
        paced by playback wall-clock. With the previous sequential dispatch
        (monitor first, then virtual), each chunk's total dispatch time was
        ≈ 2 × audio_duration. The audible consequence: the monitor's PyAudio
        queue drained to silence during the virtual.write blocking phase,
        producing the "gap after GPU drops" symptom the 3060 smoke
        2026-05-16 pinned (gen 3: dispatch-to-dispatch deltas of 7.57 s and
        3.46 s for 3.96 s / 1.98 s audio chunks respectively — almost
        exactly 2× the audio duration).

        Running the two writes concurrently brings the per-dispatch time
        down to ≈ max(monitor_write, virtual_write) ≈ 1× audio_duration —
        the floor set by the slower of the two devices. PyAudio's own
        per-stream lock is independent across stream instances, so the
        two writes don't contend at the PortAudio layer.

        NOTE 2026-05-17 follow-up: asyncio.gather here alone is not
        sufficient — the service `play_audio_chunk` methods are
        async-in-name-only and historically called `stream.write` on the
        event-loop thread, so a single-threaded asyncio loop serialized
        the writes regardless. The actual fix lives at the service layer:
        both `MonitorAudioService.play_audio_chunk` and
        `VirtualMicrophoneService.play_audio_chunk` now wrap the blocking
        PyAudio write in `asyncio.to_thread`, releasing the event loop
        so this gather can interleave them on the asyncio scheduler.

                added for PyAudio internal latency, and the wait is capped
