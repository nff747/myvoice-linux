"""Install-time model predownload entrypoint.

Invoked from `MyVoice.exe --predownload-models --tier=<small|quality>`,
typically from the Inno Setup installer's post-extraction phase. Pre-
populates the HuggingFace cache with the chosen tier's three model IDs
(CustomVoice, VoiceDesign, Base) so the first user-facing generation
doesn't have to wait for the multi-GB download.

Design constraints:
  * Must NOT import torch, transformers, or PyQt6 — those are heavy and
    irrelevant for a download. Only `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`
    is required.
  * Must NOT call MyVoiceApp / configuration_service / model_registry —
    those drag in the full graph.
  * Cache location is the default HuggingFace cache. UAC-elevated
    installers still run under the same user session, so the cache
    populated here is the same one the runtime app reads later.
  * Must restrict the download to ONLY the files `from_pretrained` would
    pull. Vanilla `snapshot_download` grabs the entire repo — for Qwen3-
    TTS repos that includes demo audios, embedded model-card media,
    notebooks, and sometimes redundant `.bin` weight copies. 2026-05-17
    smoke surfaced this: snapshot_download ran 30+ minutes while
    `from_pretrained` from the same repo finishes in 1-2 minutes. The
    `_ALLOW_PATTERNS` list below mirrors the file set observed in the
    HF cache after a successful `from_pretrained` (config + tokenizer
    + safetensors + speech_tokenizer subfolder).
  * Exit codes: 0 = success, 1 = bad args, 2 = download failure. The
    installer is expected to treat exit code 2 as "warn user, app will
    download on first launch instead" rather than failing the install.
