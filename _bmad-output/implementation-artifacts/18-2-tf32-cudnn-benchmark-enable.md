# Story 18.2: TF32 + cuDNN Benchmark Enable

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->
<!-- Phase tag: Phase ⊥-Polish-2 (D-20). Second story of Epic 18 (Generation-Speed Optimizations). Successor to Story 18.1 (Underrun-Gap Mitigation), which closed as instrumentation-only after pinning the bottleneck to the producer side at 3.23× steady-state ratio. -->
<!-- Risk: Low (per `epics-optimization-pass.md:244`). Lossless toggle on the precision the model already uses; matmul TF32 drift ~1e-4, perceptually inaudible per public PyTorch guidance and prior Ampere+ deployments. -->
<!-- Audition discipline: Commander solo, no L2/L3 recruitment (per `epics-optimization-pass.md:241` + Story 18.2 stub at `:1363`). The drift is well-known to be sub-perceptual; the spot-check is documentary diligence, not a gate. -->

## Story

As a **MyVoice user generating TRUE_STREAM utterances on an Ampere-or-newer CUDA host**,
I want **the application to opt into PyTorch's lossless TF32 matmul + cuDNN benchmark autotune at startup**,
so that **first-chunk latency drops 10–30% on Ampere+ tensor cores at zero perceptual cost, composing with Stories 18.3 + 18.4 toward the cumulative ~25 s → ~10 s long-form-utterance target the Epic 18 plan promises**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** the application starts on an Ampere-or-newer CUDA host (`torch.cuda.is_available() == True` AND `torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[0] >= 8` — RTX 30xx/40xx/50xx in the documented ship-target per `memory/hardware_setup.md`)
**When** the new startup-side opt-in fires before the QApplication / QwenTTSService initialization
**Then** all three of the following PyTorch global flags become `True`:
  - `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32`
  - `torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32`
  - `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark`

**And** the opt-in emits exactly one INFO-level log line on the application logger (e.g., `"TF32 + cuDNN benchmark enabled (device_capability=8.9)"`) so Commander can confirm engagement at runtime by inspecting `myvoice.log`
**And** the opt-in is **idempotent** — calling the enable function twice in the same process produces the same final flag state and no exception. The second-call discipline is implemented by checking the three `torch.backends.*` values on entry: if all three are already True AND the host is Ampere+, short-circuit at DEBUG level (no second INFO log, no second metric record). No module-level mutable state (this preserves Story 16.2's `streaming_mode.py` pure-function discipline; the only departure is the deliberate side-effect set itself).

**Given** the application starts on a CPU-only host (`torch.cuda.is_available() == False`) OR a pre-Ampere CUDA host (compute capability < 8.0 — e.g., RTX 20xx Turing, GTX 10xx Pascal)
**When** the same startup-side opt-in fires
**Then** **none** of the three PyTorch global flags are mutated from their default values (CPU/older-GPU path is identifiably unchanged — `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32` and `torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32` remain at their PyTorch-installed defaults; `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark` remains `False`)
**And** the opt-in logs a single DEBUG-level explanation of the skip with a structured reason (`"cuda_unavailable"` for CPU, `"pre_ampere"` for compute < 8.0, with the actual `device_capability` value if cuda is available)
**And** D-9 / NFR12 (hardware-aware default discipline; CPU-only hosts stay on the V2 baseline) are preserved verbatim (the `streaming_mode.py:54-56` Ampere+ check is the precedent the new probe mirrors structurally)

**Given** the opt-in fires (either branch — engaged or skipped)
**When** the telemetry emission completes
**Then** a single `metrics.record(...)` call captures the outcome on the established D-19 telemetry surface:
  - **Ampere+ engaged branch:** `metrics.record("tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled", 1.0, device_capability="<major>.<minor>")` (e.g., `device_capability="8.9"`)
  - **Skipped branch:** `metrics.record("tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled", 0.0, reason="cuda_unavailable" | "pre_ampere", device_capability="<major>.<minor>" if cuda else "none")`

**And** the metric name (`tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled`) is documented at the new module's docstring + at the evidence file §"Telemetry breadcrumb" so Stories 18.3 + 18.4 can correlate their throughput uplifts against confirmed-engaged TF32+cuDNN baselines
**And** the metric emission integrates with the existing `metrics.record(name, value, **tags)` pub-sub helper at `src/myvoice/observability/metrics.py:77` (no new metric infrastructure; same listener surface that Story 18.1's three CSV-capture metrics use)

**Given** the new module wires the probe + enable + telemetry into `src/myvoice/main.py`
**When** the wire-up lands
**Then** the call fires **at startup, before `QwenTTSService` initialization**, so the flags are global to the process from the earliest correct moment (the exact placement — module-level after the `import torch` block vs. inside `main()` after `setup_logging()` returns — is deferred to Open Question #1 because the choice has runtime-observable consequences for where the INFO log line lands)
**And** the wire-up is **a single function call** — `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()` — not inlined logic at the call site (so the call site stays readable and the unit-testable surface is the function, not `main.py`'s startup sequence)
**And** the wire-up is **unconditional from main.py's perspective** — `main.py` does NOT inspect hardware capability before calling; the probe lives inside the function. This keeps the conditional-logic surface in one place (the new module) instead of scattered across `main.py` + the new module.
**And** `main.py`'s existing torch-before-PyQt6 DLL ordering invariant per `memory/torch_pyqt6_dll_ordering.md` is preserved verbatim (the new call sits after the torch import, before any PyQt6 import) regardless of which placement Open Question #1 resolves to

**Given** the new module is wired and engaged
**When** Commander runs the canonical Story 17.3 §4.1 step 3 long-form CLONED utterance (Sarira-F, ≥250 chars / ~22 s of speech) on the RTX 5090 dev host with the same `MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV` env-var-gated capture infrastructure that Story 18.1 shipped (`src/myvoice/observability/progressive_playback_csv_capture.py`)
**Then** the captured `metrics.first_chunk_latency_ms` value (already-aggregated by the `_FirstChunkLatencyAggregator` at `qwen_tts_service.py:362`) is compared head-to-head against the **same utterance under the same conditions with the new opt-in disabled** (a one-line revert of the wire-up in `main.py`, captured to a second CSV)
**And** the measurement is captured at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-tf32-cudnn-benchmark-enable-evidence.md §"NFR1 first-chunk-latency measurement"` with both raw CSVs (`18-2-rtx5090-tf32-on.csv` + `18-2-rtx5090-tf32-off.csv`), median + p90 + p95, and the absolute + percent delta
**And** the captured percent delta is surfaced verbatim to Commander in the closure note (Task 8) — the Epic 18 stub at `:1361` quotes a 10–30% speedup as the *anticipated* gate; the dev agent does NOT unilaterally interpret tails outside that range as pass/fail. If the measured median speedup falls outside [10%, 30%], the dev agent flags this in the closure note (Open Question #4 below) and waits for Commander's call rather than declaring the story closed or stalled.
**And** zero NFR3 perceptual defects are reported by Commander on the same utterance — Sarira-F long-form audition by Commander solo, no L2/L3 recruitment per Epic 18's Commander-solo discipline for 18.1 + 18.2

**Given** the chosen mitigation lands
**When** any host without Ampere+ CUDA support runs the application
**Then** the CPU-only / pre-Ampere path is **identifiably unchanged** (per AC #2 above, verified by absence of flag mutation + absence of telemetry-record emission with `value=1.0` on those hosts)
**And** no new tunables or settings are exposed (no `AppSettings` field, no UI toggle — the flags engage automatically and unconditionally on Ampere+; users who want to disable them edit the new module, but that is a developer operation, not a user-facing setting; Story 18.3's `tts_precision = "fp32" | "bf16" | "auto"` is the *first* Epic 18 user-facing tunable per the epic stub at `:1377`, not this story)

**Given** the test suite runs after the source-tree edits
**When** the regression sweep executes
**Then** the existing Story 18.1 instrumentation tests (22 tests across `tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback_instrumentation.py` + `tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_true_stream_instrumentation.py` + `tests/unit/observability/test_progressive_playback_csv_capture.py`) pass with **zero regressions**
**And** the existing Story 17.3 progressive-playback tests (32 tests across `tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_true_stream_callback.py` + `tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback.py` + `tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback_cancel.py` + `tests/integration/test_progressive_playback_dispatch_skip.py`) pass with **zero regressions**
**And** the existing Story 16.2 streaming-mode hardware-probe tests at `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_streaming_mode.py` pass with zero regressions (the new module is a sibling of `streaming_mode.py` — same package; touching that package's `__init__.py` for the new export must not regress 16.2's import chain)
**And** new unit tests at `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py` (or equivalent path mirroring `test_streaming_mode.py`'s location) cover all four hardware truth-table branches:
  - cuda available + Ampere+ (capability ≥ 8.0) → all three flags True + INFO log + metric value 1.0
  - cuda available + pre-Ampere (capability 7.5 — Turing) → flags unchanged + DEBUG skip log + metric value 0.0 with `reason="pre_ampere"`
  - cuda unavailable (CPU-only) → flags unchanged + DEBUG skip log + metric value 0.0 with `reason="cuda_unavailable"`
  - second call within same process → idempotent (no error, no double-log, final flag state same as first call)

**Given** the bundled-environment smoke from Story 17.3 §4.1 procedure remains the production-verification gate
**When** the dev agent runs the bundled smoke after the source-tree edits
**Then** a fresh `build_release.bat` cycle produces a `build_tools/dist/MyVoice/MyVoice.exe` portable bundle
**And** Commander's bundled-mode runtime confirms the `myvoice.log` contains the expected single INFO-level "TF32 + cuDNN benchmark enabled (device_capability=...)" line on the RTX 5090 ship-target host
**And** Commander confirms zero perceptual defects on the same Sarira-F long-form utterance compared to the Story 17.3 / 18.1 baseline — i.e., the lossless-TF32 promise (sub-1e-4 matmul drift) holds on the actual production-bundled artifact, not just the dev source tree
**And** the bundled-smoke evidence is captured at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-tf32-cudnn-benchmark-enable-evidence.md §"Bundled smoke"` — the same Story 17.3 / 18.1 / 17.2 / 17.1 evidence-file pattern

**Given** the story is closed
**When** the post-implementation accounting runs
**Then** the change log records the absolute + percent first-chunk-latency delta (Task 4) so Stories 18.3 + 18.4 can baseline their throughput uplifts against a TF32-already-engaged starting point — i.e., the `metrics.first_chunk_latency_ms` value Stories 18.3 + 18.4 measure is the post-18.2 number, not the pre-18.2 number
**And** the architecture document `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture-optimization-pass.md` is **NOT** amended (per Epic 18 framing at `:234`: "No new D-decisions"; D-9 / NFR1 / NFR3 / NFR7 / NFR12 are all preserved verbatim by Story 18.2)
**And** no `requirements.txt` / installer-spec / `build_release.bat` edits are made (per Epic 18 framing at `:248`: "18.1–18.3 are pure source-tree edits; no `requirements.txt` / installer-spec / `build_release.bat` changes anticipated")

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 — New `torch_runtime.py` module: hardware probe + flag enable + telemetry** (AC: #1, #2, #3, #6)
  Build the testable, side-effect-free probe + the thin idempotent enable side-effect. Mirror Story 16.2's `streaming_mode.py` pattern (signal-free, side-effect-free decision + a thin separate enable path), so the conditional-logic surface lives in exactly one module and is unit-testable without a real GPU.
  - [x] 1.1 Create `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py`. Module docstring cites Epic 18 + Story 18.2 + Epic 18 stub `:1347` + the Ampere+ guard precedent at `streaming_mode.py:54-56`. Same import discipline as `streaming_mode.py`: lazy-import torch inside the probe function (so monkeypatch of `torch.cuda.is_available` and `torch.cuda.get_device_capability` is honored without import-order gymnastics), no peer imports from `myvoice.*`.
  - [x] 1.2 Implement `is_ampere_or_newer() -> bool`. Returns False if `torch.cuda.is_available()` is False; otherwise returns `torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[0] >= 8`. Document the capability-major mapping inline (Ampere = 8.x including 8.9 RTX 40xx + 8.6 RTX 30xx; Hopper = 9.x; Blackwell = 10.x RTX 50xx; pre-Ampere = Turing 7.5 / Pascal 6.x). The `>= 8` test is forward-compatible (Hopper / Blackwell / future architectures all satisfy it).
  - [x] 1.3 Implement `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark() -> dict`. Returns a small status dict: `{"engaged": bool, "reason": str | None, "device_capability": tuple[int, int] | None}` so the wire-up at `main.py` (Task 2) can log a single line carrying the actionable detail without re-probing torch. Internally:
      - **Idempotency check first.** On entry, if `is_ampere_or_newer()` is True AND all three `torch.backends.*` flags are already True, log at DEBUG ("TF32 + cuDNN already enabled — no-op"), return the engaged-True status dict, do NOT re-emit the metric, do NOT re-log INFO. The first-call observable behavior is the contract; subsequent calls are equivalence-class no-ops. **No module-level mutable state** — the flag values themselves are the canonical "have we run" signal. This preserves Story 16.2's `streaming_mode.py` pure-function discipline; the only deliberate departure is the side-effect set itself, kept minimal.
      - If `is_ampere_or_newer()` is False, determine reason (`"cuda_unavailable"` if `not torch.cuda.is_available()`; else `"pre_ampere"`); log a single DEBUG line with the reason; emit `metrics.record("tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled", 0.0, reason=reason, device_capability=...)` telemetry; return the engaged-False status dict.
      - If `is_ampere_or_newer()` is True AND not all three flags are already set, set the three flags to True (`torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32`, `torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32`, `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark`); log a single INFO line; emit `metrics.record("tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled", 1.0, device_capability="<major>.<minor>")` telemetry; return the engaged-True status dict.
  - [x] 1.4 Update `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/__init__.py`: add `is_ampere_or_newer` and `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark` to the package's `from ... import` list and `__all__` (mirroring how `default_streaming_mode_for_hardware` is exported). The two new exports sit alongside `StreamingMode` / `default_streaming_mode_for_hardware` / `effective_streaming_mode` since they are conceptually the same surface (hardware-gated startup-side decisions).

- [x] **Task 2 — Wire `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()` into `main.py` startup** (AC: #4)
  Single-call wire-up at the canonical earliest-correct startup point. No conditional logic at the call site (Task 1.3 owns the conditional surface). Preserves the torch-before-PyQt6 DLL ordering invariant.
  Per OQ #1 resolution: placed inside `main()` immediately after `setup_logging()` returns and before `setup_application()` is called (the recommended placement; INFO breadcrumb lands in `myvoice.log` via the file handler `setup_logging()` configures, not stderr-only).
  - [x] 2.1 Edit `src/myvoice/main.py`. Immediately after the existing torch-import `try: import torch / except (ImportError, OSError): pass` block (currently `:42-49`), add a guarded import + call to the new function. Guard the import with the same `try / except ImportError` discipline the file already uses for torch — if the import fails (e.g., during a partial install), the application MUST continue to start, with a single warning log; the absence of the speedup is non-fatal. Concretely:
      ```python
      # Story 18.2: enable lossless TF32 + cuDNN benchmark autotune on Ampere+
      # (no-op on CPU / pre-Ampere). Preserves D-9 / NFR12 hardware-aware
      # default discipline.
      try:
          from myvoice.services.tts_streaming.torch_runtime import enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark
          enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()
      except Exception as _tf32_err:
          # Non-fatal: the speedup is opt-in; absence is the V2 baseline.
          logging.getLogger(__name__).warning(
              f"TF32 + cuDNN benchmark enable failed (continuing without speedup): {_tf32_err}"
          )
      ```
      The placement is BEFORE `setup_application()` runs at `:60-102` and BEFORE the qasync import / event-loop creation, so the flags are global to the process from the earliest possible moment.
  - [x] 2.2 Verify the placement does NOT violate the torch-before-PyQt6 DLL ordering invariant: the new code touches only `myvoice.services.tts_streaming.torch_runtime` (which lazy-imports torch inside the probe) and the standard library `logging` module; it does NOT import PyQt6. The PyQt6 import block at `:51-54` stays unchanged and runs after the new call.
  - [x] 2.3 Verify the placement does NOT change `setup_logging()` ordering: `setup_logging()` runs inside `main()` at `:334`, AFTER module-level code finishes. The new wire-up at module level (or inside `main()` BEFORE `setup_application()` but AFTER `setup_logging()`) — pick whichever placement keeps the new INFO/DEBUG log line landing in the expected `myvoice.log` file. **Recommended:** place the new call at the top of `main()` immediately after `setup_logging()` returns and BEFORE `setup_application()` is called, so the log line lands in `myvoice.log` rather than getting lost on stderr. Document the placement choice at evidence file §"Wire-up placement".

- [x] **Task 3 — Unit tests at `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py`** (AC: #7)
  Mirror `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_streaming_mode.py`'s structure; same monkeypatch-the-torch-API pattern; PyTest-only, no real GPU required. **15 tests landed, all passing on `python310` first run.**
  - [x] 3.1 Test: cuda available + Ampere → engaged. Monkeypatch `torch.cuda.is_available` to return True; monkeypatch `torch.cuda.get_device_capability` to return `(8, 9)`. Assert `is_ampere_or_newer()` returns True; assert `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()` returns a dict with `engaged=True` + `device_capability=(8, 9)`; assert (via spy/listener on the metrics module) that exactly one `metrics.record("tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled", 1.0, ...)` call fires; assert all three `torch.backends.*` flags are True after the call.
  - [x] 3.2 Test: cuda available + pre-Ampere (Turing 7.5) → skipped. Monkeypatch `torch.cuda.is_available` → True; `torch.cuda.get_device_capability` → `(7, 5)`. Assert `is_ampere_or_newer()` returns False; assert `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()` returns `engaged=False, reason="pre_ampere"`; assert metric records 0.0 with `reason="pre_ampere"`. **Critical:** assert the three `torch.backends.*` flags retain the values they had BEFORE the call (capture them in the test's `setUp` / fixture and compare). Do NOT assume any specific PyTorch default; the contract is "no mutation," not "specific value preserved."
  - [x] 3.3 Test: cuda unavailable (CPU-only) → skipped. Monkeypatch `torch.cuda.is_available` → False; `torch.cuda.get_device_capability` should NOT be called (defensive — pre-Ampere systems may not even have CUDA installed; the function must early-out on `is_available()=False` without touching `get_device_capability`). Assert `engaged=False, reason="cuda_unavailable"`; assert metric records 0.0 with `reason="cuda_unavailable"`; assert flags unchanged. **Implemented by patching `get_device_capability` to RAISE so any accidental invocation surfaces immediately.**
  - [x] 3.4 Test: idempotency — second call within same process. Set up Ampere+ monkeypatch; pre-set the three `torch.backends.*` flags to True (simulating a prior call's effect); call `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()`; assert the function returns `engaged=True` with the correct `device_capability`; assert no INFO log fires (only DEBUG); assert no NEW `metrics.record` call fires (the function observes the already-engaged state and short-circuits at DEBUG level). Because the implementation reads the flag values directly (no module-level state per Task 1.3), this test does NOT need a module-level reset fixture — but DOES need to capture and restore the three `torch.backends.*` flags around the test (use a `@pytest.fixture` that snapshots-and-restores, mirroring how Task 3.2 captures flags before assertion). Document the snapshot-and-restore fixture at the test-file docstring. **Two idempotency tests landed: pre-set-True scenario + back-to-back-from-cold scenario.**
  - [x] 3.5 Test: telemetry tag schema. For both branches (engaged and skipped), assert the metric record's tags dict carries `device_capability` as a string (formatted `"<major>.<minor>"` for cuda-available paths; either `"none"` or omitted for the cuda-unavailable branch — pick one and document at the function docstring). The string-vs-tuple choice matters because Story 18.1's CSV-capture infrastructure stringifies tag values; the metric must be CSV-compatible from day one. **Resolved per OQ #2 → `"none"` sentinel. Parametrized across 5 hardware shapes (8.9, 10.0, 9.0, 7.5, cuda-unavailable).**
  - [x] 3.6 Test: D-19 listener-isolation discipline. If the new module's metric emission raises (e.g., a buggy listener), the function MUST still successfully set the flags; the broader application startup MUST NOT abort. This mirrors the metrics module's own AC #9 listener-exception isolation at `metrics.py:144-region`. Test by registering a listener that raises; assert the function returns engaged=True with all flags set; assert the exception was logged but did not propagate.

- [x] **Task 4 — NFR1 first-chunk-latency empirical measurement** (AC: #5) — **Closed 2026-05-09 per OQ #3 (a) routing: ship-as-engaged + move to 18.3. Single-shot capture showed −2.4% inter-chunk-emit median (out-of-range vs anticipated [10%, 30%]); Story 18.1 ratio essentially preserved (3.21× → 3.29×); confounders documented (cuDNN autotune cold cost most likely); producer bottleneck is the named target of 18.3 + 18.4, not 18.2. See evidence file §4.4 + §4.6.**
  The Epic 18 stub at `:1361` quotes "10–30% on RTX 5090" as the anticipated acceptance gate. The dev agent's job is to capture the data and surface the percent-delta number to Commander; tails outside [10%, 30%] route to Open Question #4 rather than dev-agent interpretation.
  - [x] 4.1 Extend the existing Story 18.1 CSV-capture infrastructure (`src/myvoice/observability/progressive_playback_csv_capture.py`) to ALSO accept `first_chunk_latency_ms` in its metric-name filter list. This is a one-line backward-compatible change; the existing three Story 18.1 metrics keep capturing as before. The committed approach (NOT a separate ad-hoc listener) so Stories 18.3 + 18.4 inherit the same first-chunk capture surface for their own throughput uplifts. Document the filter-list extension at evidence file §"Measurement methodology" (one paragraph: "extended the Story 18.1 CSV-capture filter to include `first_chunk_latency_ms` for Story 18.2 measurement; reused for 18.3 + 18.4"). **Implemented + 2 new tests added at `test_progressive_playback_csv_capture.py` (`test_only_targeted_metrics_are_captured` updated; new `test_first_chunk_latency_row_columns_match_header`). 14/14 passing.**
  - [ ] **DEVIATION** 4.2 Capture the **after** measurement first (the wire-up is part of this story's HEAD commit, so it's already in place). Run the canonical Story 17.3 §4.1 step 3 paragraph (Sarira-F long-form, ≥250 chars / ~22 s of speech) on the RTX 5090 dev host with `MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV` set; capture **N=10 generations minimum** to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-rtx5090-tf32-on.csv`. Each generation must be a fresh process launch (kill the app between runs) so cuDNN benchmark autotune cache state does not bleed across runs. Record `first_chunk_latency_ms` median + p90 + p95. **DEVIATION (closed per OQ #3 (a)): single-shot N=1 captured 2026-05-09 19:23. first_chunk_latency_ms = 7800 ms; inter-chunk-emit median = 6515 ms; emit/audio ratio = 3.29×. Full N=10 deferred — see §4.6 routing. Marker changed from `[x]` → `[ ]` per code-review pass H1: surface checkbox should not over-claim spec-deviated work. The body's "DEVIATION" tag is now visually consistent with the unchecked marker.**
  - [ ] **DEVIATION** 4.3 Capture the **before** baseline by checking out the parent commit (the commit BEFORE Task 2's wire-up landed — i.e., HEAD~1 if the wire-up commit is the current HEAD; whichever git ref is the immediate ancestor of the wire-up). Run N=10 generations on the SAME Sarira-F utterance; capture to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-rtx5090-tf32-off.csv`. Record median + p90 + p95. **Critical:** do NOT measure by source-tree-edits-then-revert; the git-commit-pair methodology eliminates the risk of forgetting the revert and ensures both runs are reproducibly identifiable. After the baseline is captured, `git checkout` back to the wire-up commit. **DEVIATION (closed per OQ #3 (a)): used implicit OFF baseline from Story 18.1's existing `18-1-instrumentation-rtx5090-longform.csv` (captured pre-Story 18.2 commit; same Sarira-F long-form utterance through same dispatch path). Inter-chunk-emit median = 6362 ms; emit/audio ratio = 3.21×. No `first_chunk_latency_ms` available in OFF baseline (filter widening Task 4.1 only landed in HEAD `787960c`). Full N=10 + git-checkout-OFF deferred — see §4.6. Marker changed from `[x]` → `[ ]` per code-review pass H1.**
  - [x] 4.4 Compute the delta. `(off_median - on_median) / off_median * 100` = percent speedup; same for p90 and p95. Capture absolute pre/post values (in ms) AND the three percent deltas at evidence file §"NFR1 first-chunk-latency measurement". Per AC #5: if the median speedup falls outside [10%, 30%], surface to Commander via Open Question #4 — do NOT declare the story done or stalled unilaterally. **TRIGGERED + RESOLVED**: single-shot inter-chunk-emit median ON vs OFF is **−2.4% (slower)**, mean is **−8.6% (slower)** — both outside the anticipated [10%, 30%] range. Routed to Commander per OQ #3 → option (a) "ship as-engaged + move to 18.3" selected 2026-05-09. Confounders documented at §4.4 (cuDNN autotune cold cost is the most likely cause; Story 18.1's 3.23× ratio essentially preserved).
  - [x] 4.5 Sanity-check that the `myvoice.log` "TF32 + cuDNN benchmark enabled (device_capability=...)" INFO line appears in the **after** runs and does NOT appear in the **before** runs. This is the runtime-engagement breadcrumb AC #1's INFO log promises and the canonical confirmation that the two CSVs really do bracket the change Story 18.2 introduces. **PASS**: verbatim INFO line at `logs/myvoice.log:3` — `"TF32 + cuDNN benchmark enabled (device_capability=12.0)"` (RTX 5090 GeForce Blackwell reports CC 12.0; docstring updated to record both Blackwell DC=10.0 and GeForce=12.0 variants for future-architecture audit).

- [x] **Task 5 — NFR3 spot-check (Commander solo)** (AC: #5)
  Per Epic 18 stub at `:241` + `:1363`: Commander solo, no L2/L3 recruitment. The TF32 matmul drift is well-known to be sub-perceptual at ≤1e-4; the spot-check is documentary diligence to confirm "no surprise on this specific qwen_tts + Sarira-F + RTX 5090 combination," not a gate.
  - [x] 5.1 On the same canonical Sarira-F long-form utterance, Commander listens to the **before** baseline (TF32 off) recording AND the **after** (TF32 on) recording back-to-back, A/B style. The two recordings already exist as the audio Tasks 4.2 + 4.3 generated; do not regenerate.
  - [x] 5.2 Commander logs perceptual observation at evidence file §"NFR3 spot-check": expected verdict = "indistinguishable" (the public PyTorch guidance for TF32 on inference is a 1e-4 round-trip error, well below human perceptual sensitivity for waveform amplitude); the documented-diligence verdict is the literal phrase "no perceptual defect detected" or "perceptual defect detected: <description>". The latter is the only branch that triggers a re-think (likely a TF32-incompatibility surprise on this specific model — the Story 18.3 NFR7 fp32 fallback machinery would then need to extend to cover TF32 too, but that is explicitly NOT this story's surface and would be Commander-routed to the architecture layer rather than absorbed by the dev agent). **VERDICT 2026-05-09: "no new perceptual defect attributable to TF32"**. Commander reported "audio still had gaps" — the gaps are the SAME Story 18.1-pinned producer-cadence gaps (3.21× → 3.29× ratio, essentially unchanged), not a new TF32-induced artifact. Lossless-TF32 promise (~1e-4 matmul drift) holds. No NFR7 architecture-layer routing required. See evidence file §5.

- [ ] **DEFERRED** **Task 6 — Bundled-environment smoke** (AC: #8) — **DEFERRED 2026-05-09 per OQ #4 + OQ #3 (a) routing.** Commander handles the bundled smoke + the build_tools/installer.iss + build_tools/version.py increments together in the next `build_release.bat` cycle as a separate build-state commit. Risk surface: PyInstaller missing the new `myvoice.services.tts_streaming.torch_runtime` module — highly unlikely given it's reachable from `main.py` via a normal import statement (PyInstaller's import-graph analysis discovers it without needing a hidden-imports entry). If the deferred bundled smoke surfaces a packaging defect, route back to Story 18.2 follow-up commit. **Marker changed from `[x]` → `[ ]` per code-review pass H2: surface checkbox should not claim completion for entirely-deferred work. AC #8 (bundled-smoke confirmation on the production-bundled artifact) is therefore unmet at story closure and is Commander-routed for the next build cycle.**
  - [ ] **DEFERRED** 6.1 Run `build_release.bat` (the standard production-bundle build cycle per `memory/build_tools_phase_perp_state.md` + `memory/production_release_state.md`). Confirm the resulting `build_tools/dist/MyVoice/MyVoice.exe` includes the new `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py` module + the `main.py` wire-up. **DEFERRED — see Task 6 header.**
  - [ ] **DEFERRED** 6.2 Launch the bundled exe. Confirm `myvoice.log` (in the portable Logs path per `setup_logging()` discipline) contains the single INFO-level "TF32 + cuDNN benchmark enabled (device_capability=...)" line on Commander's RTX 5090 + Win11 ship-target host. Commander logs this at evidence file §"Bundled smoke" with a verbatim log excerpt. **DEFERRED — see Task 6 header.**
  - [ ] **DEFERRED** 6.3 In the bundled exe, run a single short-class TTS generation (the Story 17.3 §4.1 step 1 short paragraph from the standard fixture). Confirm no new error, warning, or unexpected log line appears around the TF32 wire-up. Confirm a TTS generation completes successfully end-to-end (audio plays through the streaming pipeline). **DEFERRED — see Task 6 header.**
  - [ ] **DEFERRED** 6.4 If the bundled smoke surfaces a defect (e.g., the new module fails to import in the PyInstaller / portable-bundle environment for a packaging reason), the dev agent surfaces it to Commander rather than absorbing it; the most likely failure mode is `MEIPASS`-path invisibility of the new module, which would be a one-line fix to PyInstaller's hidden-imports list at `build_tools/`. Document at evidence file §"Bundled smoke". **DEFERRED — see Task 6 header.**

- [x] **Task 7 — Regression test sweep** (AC: #7)
  Verify the new module + wire-up does not regress the established surfaces.
  - [x] 7.1 Run the new Task 3 unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py -v`. Expect 6–8 tests pass (one per Task 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3 / 3.4 / 3.6; Task 3.5 covers tag schema for both engaged + skipped branches → 1–3 tests depending on parametrization). Exact count is informational; the contract is "all six Task 3 subtasks have at least one passing test that exercises them." **15/15 PASS** (parametrized tag-schema test expands the count above the 6–8 estimate).
  - [x] 7.2 Run the existing Story 18.1 instrumentation tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback_instrumentation.py tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_true_stream_instrumentation.py tests/unit/observability/test_progressive_playback_csv_capture.py -v`. Expect 22 tests pass (the count Story 18.1 closed at). **23/23 PASS** (6 + 3 + 14, the +1 vs Story 18.1's 22 is the new Task 4.1 row-columns test).
  - [x] 7.3 Run the existing Story 17.3 progressive-playback tests: `pytest tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_true_stream_callback.py tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback.py tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback_cancel.py tests/integration/test_progressive_playback_dispatch_skip.py -v`. Expect 32 tests pass (the count Story 18.1 closed at after the Story 17.3 suite expanded). **32/32 PASS**.
  - [x] 7.4 Run the Story 16.2 streaming-mode tests: `pytest tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_streaming_mode.py -v`. Expect zero regressions from the Task 1.4 `__init__.py` widening. **16/16 PASS**.
  - [x] 7.5 Run the broader streaming + app + audio + observability surface: `pytest tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_dispatch.py tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_session_integration.py tests/unit/observability/ tests/unit/test_app_progressive_playback*.py tests/integration/test_progressive_playback_dispatch_skip.py -v`. Expect ~166+ tests pass with zero regressions (Story 18.1's broader-sweep count, plus the new 6 from Task 7.1). **152/152 PASS** (the broader sweep without test_torch_runtime; 152 + 15 new = 167 grand total).

- [x] **Task 8 — Code-review pass** (post-implementation)
  - [x] 8.1 Run `/bmad-bmm-code-review`. Per `memory/code_review_regression_test_exact_class.md`: HIGH/MEDIUM-fix regression tests must mirror the exact bug class. Expected review-finding categories for this story: (a) idempotency contract drift (the second-call discipline is the most-easily-broken AC); (b) telemetry tag schema drift (string vs tuple `device_capability`); (c) wire-up placement drift (between `setup_logging()` and `setup_application()` is the contract; landing it elsewhere subtly breaks AC #4); (d) test discipline — Task 3.4 idempotency reset must use a fixture not module-level state; (e) bundled-smoke evidence file completeness. **Pass executed 2026-05-09: 4 HIGH (H1 deviation marker, H2 deferred marker, H3 misleading comment, H4 missed `__all__` pin regression) + 3 MEDIUM (M1 exception scope, M2 docstring overpromise, M3 default-filename naming-rot) + 4 LOW found. All HIGH + MEDIUM auto-fixed; LOW tracked under "Review Follow-ups (AI)" below.**
  - [x] 8.2 Address findings. Re-run code-review twice after non-trivial auto-fixes (the established Stories 16.7 / 16.8 / 17.1 / 17.2 / 17.3 / 18.1 pattern). Commit per the established Story-NNN: code-review pass — H#/M#/L# fixes pattern. **Findings auto-fixed in code (H3, H4, M1, M2, M3) and in story file (H1, H2 — surface checkbox markers). Test sweep post-fix: 164/164 in tts_streaming + observability; 158/158 in the broader Story 18.1+18.2 sweep. The two pre-existing `__all__`-pin failures from Story 18.2's commit (H4) are now resolved.**

- **Review Follow-ups (AI)**
  - [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] L1 — `torch_runtime.py` lazy-imports `torch` in three functions (`is_ampere_or_newer:100`, `_all_three_flags_already_true:127`, `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark:184`). Python `sys.modules` caching makes the cost negligible, but the redundancy is style smell; a single lazy import passed through helpers would be cleaner.
  - [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] L2 — `_all_three_flags_already_true` uses `is True` identity check at `torch_runtime.py:128-132`. Works because PyTorch returns interned `True/False` singletons, but third-party code that sets these flags to truthy non-bool (e.g., `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = 1`) would silently bypass the idempotency short-circuit. Consider `bool(...)` for defensive robustness, OR document that the contract is "literally the True singleton."
  - [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] L3 — `test_enable_skips_on_pre_ampere_*` and `test_enable_skips_on_cpu_only_*` at `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py:156, 203` assert metric records but do NOT assert the DEBUG log fires. AC #2 explicitly requires "the opt-in logs a single DEBUG-level explanation of the skip with a structured reason." A regression that deletes the DEBUG log lines would not be caught. Add `caplog`-based DEBUG-log assertions to both skip-branch tests.
  - [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] L4 — No unit test for `main.py` wire-up location. AC #4 mandates the call between `setup_logging()` and `setup_application()`; only the runtime breadcrumb in `myvoice.log:3` (Task 4.5 PASS) confirms placement. A future refactor could silently move/remove the call without test failure. Consider an AST-based test that locates the `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark` call in `main.py` and asserts it sits between the two reference functions, OR a subprocess test that spawns `python -m myvoice.main` and greps the log for the breadcrumb.

## Dev Notes

### What this story is

Story 18.2 is the second story of Epic 18 (Generation-Speed Optimizations / Phase ⊥-Polish-2). It enables PyTorch's lossless TF32 + cuDNN benchmark autotune at startup on Ampere-or-newer CUDA hosts, gated on a hardware probe that mirrors Story 16.2's `streaming_mode.py:54-56` precedent.

This is the **cheapest available speedup** in the Epic 18 plan (per `epics-optimization-pass.md:1349`). It composes with Story 18.3 (bf16 precision) and Story 18.4 (`torch.compile`) toward the cumulative Epic 18 throughput target: a 25-second long-form CLONED utterance generating in ~10s instead of ~40s on the RTX 5090, with no perceptual quality regression.

The change is structurally tiny (~5 LOC of substantive logic, plus a probe + telemetry wrapper) but the testable surface is a discrete module so the conditional logic is unit-testable without a real GPU. This is the same pattern Story 16.2 established for `streaming_mode.py`.

### What this story is NOT

- **Not a precision change.** TF32 is the same fp32 numerical path PyTorch already uses; the matmul rounding loses ~1e-4 precision on Ampere+ tensor cores. This is NOT bf16 (Story 18.3) and NOT fp16 (out of scope per Epic 18 framing at `:250`).
- **Not a producer-side throughput rework.** Story 18.1's evidence file §4.4 pinned the long-form-utterance bottleneck to producer cadence (talker model decode rate at 31% real-time, ratio 3.23×). TF32 helps the matmul-bound segments of the producer side, which is *part of* the bottleneck Story 18.1 identified, but the named "fix class" for the producer bottleneck is Stories 18.3 (bf16) + 18.4 (`torch.compile`) per the Story 18.1 evidence file §4.4 verdict. Story 18.2 is a complement, not a substitute.
- **Not an audition cycle.** Stories 18.3 + 18.4 trigger the full ≥3-listener NFR3 re-audition mirroring Story 17.1's protocol. Story 18.1 + 18.2 are explicitly Commander-solo per `epics-optimization-pass.md:241`. The 1e-4 matmul drift is sub-perceptual; the Task 5 spot-check is documentary diligence, not a gate.
- **Not a CPU / pre-Ampere change.** Per D-9 / NFR12, CPU-only and pre-Ampere hosts (Turing 7.5, Pascal 6.x) stay on their current behavior. The flags engage only on Ampere+ CUDA hosts. The hardware probe is the gate.
- **Not a build-pipeline change.** No `requirements.txt` / installer-spec / `build_release.bat` edits anticipated; pure source-tree edits picked up by the next build cycle. Per Epic 18 framing at `:248`.
- **Not a user-facing setting.** No `AppSettings` field, no UI toggle. The flags engage automatically and unconditionally on Ampere+. Story 18.3's `tts_precision = "fp32" | "bf16" | "auto"` is the *first* Epic 18 user-facing tunable per the epic stub at `:1377`, not this story.
- **Not an architecture amendment.** Per Epic 18 framing at `:234`: "No new D-decisions." D-9 / NFR1 / NFR3 / NFR7 / NFR12 are all preserved verbatim by Story 18.2.

### Source tree components to touch

**Read-only (analysis/reference):**
- `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/streaming_mode.py:54-56` — the canonical Ampere+ probe precedent (Story 16.2). Story 18.2's new probe mirrors this structurally (lazy torch import; no peer imports; pure decision function).
- `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/__init__.py` — package re-export pattern. Task 1.4 widens this with the two new public symbols.
- `src/myvoice/observability/metrics.py:77-150-region` — `metrics.record(name, value, **tags)` API surface. Task 1.3's telemetry uses this verbatim; same listener pattern Story 18.1's three CSV-capture metrics use.
- `src/myvoice/services/qwen_tts_service.py:362-region + :3134 + :4136` — existing `first_chunk_latency_ms` recording sites. Task 4's NFR1 measurement consumes the metric Story 18.1's CSV-capture infrastructure (`MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV`) needs to extend to.
- `src/myvoice/observability/progressive_playback_csv_capture.py` — Story 18.1's env-var-gated CSV capture. Task 4.1 picks between extending it to also capture `first_chunk_latency_ms` (one-line filter list change) OR running a separate listener for this story.

**New (source tree):**
- `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py` (Task 1) — the new probe + enable + telemetry module. Single file, ~80 LOC including docstring + the two functions.

**Edit (source tree):**
- `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/__init__.py` (Task 1.4) — two new public symbols added to imports + `__all__`.
- `src/myvoice/main.py` (Task 2) — single guarded import + call; placement after `setup_logging()` and before `setup_application()` per Task 2.3.
- (optional, Task 4.1) `src/myvoice/observability/progressive_playback_csv_capture.py` — one-line filter-list extension if the CSV-capture path is the chosen measurement gate. Backwards-compatible.

**New (tests):**
- `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py` (Task 3) — six tests mirroring `test_streaming_mode.py`'s structure. Same monkeypatch pattern; PyTest-only, no real GPU.

**New (evidence + measurement artifacts):**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-tf32-cudnn-benchmark-enable-evidence.md` (Tasks 4.4, 5.2, 6.2). Force-add via `git add -f` per the Story 16.9 / 17.1 / 17.2 / 17.3 / 18.1 evidence-file precedent (`_bmad-output/` is gitignored per `memory/git_repo_state.md`).
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-rtx5090-tf32-off.csv` (Task 4.2) — N=5 baseline. Force-add same as evidence file.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-rtx5090-tf32-on.csv` (Task 4.3) — N=5 post-enable. Force-add same as evidence file.

### Testing standards summary

- **Unit tests:** mirror Story 16.2's `test_streaming_mode.py` patterns. Monkeypatch `torch.cuda.is_available` and `torch.cuda.get_device_capability` at the attribute-access level (not by binding a function reference) so the lazy-import discipline in the new module is honored. PyAudio / Qt / qwen-tts NOT involved in this test surface — the new module is isolated to torch attribute-checks.
- **No real GPU required.** All hardware-truth-table branches (Ampere, pre-Ampere, CPU-only) are exercised via monkeypatch. The real-GPU-only validation lives in Tasks 4 + 5 + 6 (NFR1 measurement, NFR3 spot-check, bundled smoke) on Commander's RTX 5090.
- **Idempotency reset discipline:** Task 3.4 must reset module-level state in a fixture, not rely on test ordering. Document this at the test-file docstring (`pytest fixture: torch_runtime_reset` or equivalent).
- **Conftest discipline:** `tests/conftest.py` already enforces torch-before-PyQt6 DLL ordering per `memory/torch_pyqt6_dll_ordering.md`. The new test file does NOT need a special preamble — it is pure-Python torch-attribute monkeypatching, no DLL-ordering surface area. If running under coverage for Task 7.5, follow the inline torch-first preamble per `memory/torch_before_coverage_dll_ordering.md`.
- **No new test-harness changes.** Story 16.2 + Story 18.1 established the patterns; this story extends them.

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified project structure:**
- New module at `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py` — sibling of `streaming_mode.py`, `codec_token_streamer.py`, `streaming_decoder.py`. Same package; same import discipline.
- New tests at `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py` — mirrors the `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_streaming_mode.py` location.
- New evidence file at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-tf32-cudnn-benchmark-enable-evidence.md` matches the per-story evidence-file pattern (Story 16.7 onward; reaffirmed for 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 18.1).
- No new top-level packages, modules, or conftest files needed.

**Detected variances:**
- The new module exports a *function with side-effect* (`enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark`) alongside Story 16.2's pure-decision functions. This is a deliberate departure: `streaming_mode.py`'s docstring explicitly says "signal-free, side-effect-free, no metrics emission" — the new module must NOT be added to the same docstring; instead, document at the new module's docstring that the side-effect is deliberate (the alternative — pure probe + caller-side flag set + caller-side metric — would scatter the conditional surface across `main.py` AND a probe module, defeating the testability goal). The conditional logic surface MUST live in exactly one place; the new module is that place.
- The new module is **stateless** — no module-level mutable state. Idempotency is implemented by reading the three `torch.backends.*` values on entry and short-circuiting if all three are already True on an Ampere+ host. This preserves Story 16.2's pure-function discipline (no class-instance state, no module-level booleans) — the only deliberate departure is the side-effect set itself, kept minimal.
- **No D-decision change.** Story 18.2 does not require an architecture amendment per `epics-optimization-pass.md:234` ("No new D-decisions"). NFR1 / NFR3 / NFR7 / D-9 / NFR12 are all preserved unchanged.

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From Story 18.1 closure (commit `956c039` + the producer-bottleneck verdict in the evidence file):**

- Story 18.1 closed as **instrumentation-only** after the Task 1.4 measurement showed a 3.23× steady-state emit-vs-drain ratio with the producer (talker) at 31% real-time. The data ruled out Options 1 + 2 (consumer-side fixes) and named Stories 18.3 (bf16) + 18.4 (`torch.compile`) as the correct fix class for the producer-side throughput defect. **Translation for Story 18.2:** TF32 is a *complementary* speedup that helps the producer-side matmul throughput, but does NOT close the 3.23× ratio by itself — the Epic 18 stub's "10–30%" speedup estimate is consistent with this (TF32 on its own would shrink the ratio to ~2.5–3.0× on a matmul-heavy workload; the rest of the gap closes after 18.3 + 18.4).
- Story 18.1 shipped the env-var-gated CSV capture infrastructure (`MYVOICE_PROGRESSIVE_PLAYBACK_CSV` + `progressive_playback_csv_capture.py`) explicitly as the empirical gate for measuring 18.3 + 18.4 throughput uplifts. **Story 18.2's Task 4 reuses this infrastructure** as the cheapest path to a `first_chunk_latency_ms` measurement. If the existing capture filter doesn't include `first_chunk_latency_ms`, extend it (one-line change) — do NOT build a parallel measurement path.
- Story 18.1 shipped the `01_Run_MyVoice_With_CSV_Capture.bat` convenience launcher. **Reuse this for Task 4** rather than constructing a new launcher.
- Story 18.1's M1 (`AudioChunk.session_id`) and the consumer-side metric session_id threading are NOT touched by Story 18.2 — the new metric (`tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled`) is a startup-once event, not a per-chunk metric, so session_id is unused for this story's telemetry.

**From Story 17.3 + Story 16.2 discipline:**

- Story 16.2's `streaming_mode.py` is the canonical Ampere+ guard precedent. The lazy-import-torch-inside-the-probe pattern (so monkeypatch.setattr is honored) is non-negotiable: the test discipline in `test_streaming_mode.py` depends on this, and the new test file at `test_torch_runtime.py` will rely on the same property.
- The `__init__.py` re-export pattern is the "expand the public surface" idiom. Add the two new symbols; do NOT scatter imports across multiple call sites in `main.py`.

**Code-review discipline from `memory/code_review_regression_test_exact_class.md`:**
- HIGH/MEDIUM-fix regression tests must mirror the **exact** bug class, not the nearest adjacent case. Translation for Story 18.2: the highest-risk regression class is **idempotency contract drift** (the second-call discipline is the most-easily-broken AC). The Task 3.4 idempotency test must exercise the second-call no-op branch directly; a test that ONLY exercises the first-call branch and assumes the second is "obvious" would be the wrong fix class for the most likely regression.
- Re-run code-review twice after non-trivial auto-fixes (the established pattern from Stories 16.7 / 16.8 / 17.1 / 17.2 / 17.3 / 18.1).

### Latest Tech Information

**TF32 (TensorFloat-32) on Ampere+ tensor cores:**
- TF32 is a 19-bit mantissa-truncated fp32 representation that PyTorch uses on Ampere+ tensor cores when `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True`. It is **not** a separate dtype — the tensor stays fp32 in memory; the tensor-core matmul internally rounds to TF32. Numerical drift vs strict fp32 is bounded at ~1e-4 round-trip per matmul, which is sub-perceptual for any TTS workload (audio amplitude perception thresholds are several orders of magnitude coarser).
- Default in modern PyTorch (2.0+): `allow_tf32` is `False` for matmul to match strict NumPy fp32 behavior; `True` for cuDNN convolutions. Story 18.2 sets BOTH to `True` for explicit, documented intent and to cover both the matmul and convolution paths in the qwen-tts model.
- Compute-capability gating: TF32 tensor cores are present on Ampere (8.0 / 8.6 / 8.9) + Hopper (9.0) + Blackwell (10.0). Pre-Ampere (Turing 7.5, Volta 7.0, Pascal 6.x) does not have TF32 tensor cores; setting the flag is a no-op on those generations, but the explicit `>= 8` guard documents intent and avoids confusion in `myvoice.log` (the INFO line confirms engagement; the DEBUG line confirms skip).

**`torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True`:**
- This enables cuDNN's autotune for convolution algorithm selection: the first call with each unique input shape pays a one-shot autotune cost (typically tens of milliseconds); subsequent calls with the same shape use the cached fastest kernel. For inference workloads with stable input shapes (qwen-tts decode loop has input-shape variation per chunk but converges to a small set), the autotune cost amortizes after a handful of generations.
- **Cold-vs-warm asymmetry:** the first generation after enabling benchmark mode may be marginally slower than baseline (the autotune cost). Task 4.3's N=5 measurement averages this out; Task 4.4's median + p95 is the canonical comparison surface.
- Default: `False`. Story 18.2 sets to `True`.

**`torch.cuda.get_device_capability()` API surface:**
- Returns `tuple[int, int]` — `(major, minor)`. RTX 5090 Blackwell: `(10, 0)`. RTX 4090 Ada: `(8, 9)`. RTX 3090 Ampere: `(8, 6)`. RTX 2080 Turing: `(7, 5)`. The `>= 8` major check is forward-compatible — Hopper (9.0), Blackwell (10.0), and any future architecture with major ≥ 8 all satisfy it.
- Defensive ordering: do NOT call `get_device_capability()` if `cuda.is_available()` is False — on a CPU-only system, the device may not exist; the call may error or warn. The Task 1.3 ordering `if not is_available(): early-out with reason="cuda_unavailable"` is the contract, NOT a polish.

**Idempotent flag set in PyTorch:**
- Setting `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True` twice is safe; the second set is a no-op at the C++ level. The idempotency contract in Story 18.2's AC #1 is about *observable side effects from the wrapper function* (one INFO log per process; one metric record per process), not about the flag-set primitive itself.

**`metrics.record` API for the telemetry breadcrumb:**
- The helper at `src/myvoice/observability/metrics.py:77` accepts `name: str`, `value: float | int | str`, optional keyword `session_id`, and arbitrary `**tags`. Story 18.2's call shape: `metrics.record("tf32_cudnn_benchmark_enabled", 1.0, device_capability="8.9")`. The `value` is `1.0` for engaged, `0.0` for skipped — keeping the metric's listener surface uniform with Story 18.1's three CSV-captured per-chunk metrics (which are all numeric values).
- Listener-exception isolation: per the metrics module's own AC #9 (`metrics.py:144-region`), a raising listener does not propagate. Task 3.6's regression test verifies this property holds for the new metric.

### Project Context Reference

- Project context: `docs/` (existing project-context.md not found; CLAUDE.md absent).
- Working directory invariants per `memory/git_repo_state.md`: V2 is canonical git repo since 2026-05-05; remote = github.com/WreckedMech117/MyVoice; `_bmad-output/` is gitignored (evidence file + CSVs need `git add -f`).
- Production state per `memory/production_release_state.md`: ships publicly via myvoicetts.com as a Windows .exe with bundled portable python310. Installer size unchanged by Story 18.2 (no `requirements.txt` / installer-spec / `build_release.bat` edits).
- Hardware target per `memory/hardware_setup.md`: RTX 5090 Blackwell (compute 10.0) dev host; ship-target covers RTX 30xx (compute 8.6) / RTX 40xx (compute 8.9). All three satisfy the new probe's `>= 8` Ampere+ gate.
- Phase context per `memory/build_tools_phase_perp_state.md`: Phase ⊥-Polish-2 is the successor to Phase ⊥-Polish (Story 17.3 closed the progressive-playback contract); Story 18.2 is the second story of Phase ⊥-Polish-2 (after Story 18.1 shipped the instrumentation that pinned the producer bottleneck).

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-opus-4-7[1m]

### Debug Log References

- Test runs executed via `./python310/python.exe -m pytest ...` per
  `memory/torch_pyqt6_dll_ordering.md` (DLL ordering enforced by
  `tests/conftest.py`).
- 2026-05-09: Story 18.1 test `test_only_targeted_metrics_are_captured`
  asserted `first_chunk_latency_ms` was filtered OUT. Updated alongside
  Task 4.1 source change so the assertion matches the new contract; new
  `test_first_chunk_latency_row_columns_match_header` test pins the row
  layout for the newly-captured metric (chunk_index / is_final /
  audio_data_size columns are blank for `first_chunk_latency_ms` rows).
- 2026-05-09 19:23: Commander ran the dev-tree single-shot capture via
  `01_Run_MyVoice_With_CSV_Capture.bat` (which the dev agent edited to
  point at `18-2-rtx5090-tf32-on.csv` and refreshed the docstring for
  Story 18.2). The capture surfaced:
    * Engagement breadcrumb at `logs/myvoice.log:3` (Task 4.5 PASS).
    * **Compute capability mismatch**: log shows `device_capability=12.0`
      (RTX 5090 GeForce Blackwell) — the original docstring had
      "Blackwell = 10.0 (RTX 50xx, B100)" conflating datacenter +
      GeForce variants. Docstring updated post-capture to record both
      DC=10.0 and GeForce=12.0 mappings with a note that NVIDIA's
      major-version assignment is not strictly chronological.
    * **TF32 ON inter-chunk-emit cadence is essentially unchanged from
      Story 18.1's OFF baseline**: 6515 ms ON vs 6362 ms OFF (median),
      a directional 2.4% slowdown well outside the anticipated [10%, 30%]
      speedup range. Routed to Commander per OQ #3; Commander selected
      option (a) "ship as-engaged + move to 18.3" 2026-05-09.

### Completion Notes List

**Story closed to `review` 2026-05-09 with deviations documented.**
All AC-level work landed; the empirical NFR1 gate (Tasks 4.2–4.4) and
the bundled-smoke gate (Task 6) closed with explicit deviations from
the original story spec, both routed through and accepted by Commander.

**Source-tree implementation (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4.1, 7) — closed straight.**

**Empirical gates (Tasks 4.2–4.5, 5) — closed with deviations:**
- Task 4.5 (engagement breadcrumb): PASS straight. INFO line at
  `logs/myvoice.log:3` confirms wire-up engaged; documented at
  evidence file §4.5.
- Tasks 4.2/4.3/4.4 (NFR1 first-chunk-latency measurement): single-shot
  N=1 captured instead of the spec'd N=10; OFF baseline used the
  pre-existing Story 18.1 CSV instead of git-checkout-parent re-run.
  Result was OUT-OF-RANGE per the anticipated [10%, 30%] speedup
  (single-shot showed −2.4% median slowdown), triggering OQ #3.
  Commander selected option (a) "ship as-engaged + move to 18.3"
  2026-05-09. Reasoning: cuDNN autotune cold-cost is the most likely
  cause of the single-shot null; Story 18.1's 3.23× ratio is essentially
  preserved (3.21× → 3.29×); TF32 was never the named producer-bottleneck
  fix class per `memory/epic18_producer_bottleneck_finding.md`; spending
  ~2 hr on N=10 + git-checkout to confirm "TF32 didn't close a
  bottleneck it was never expected to close" was deemed low-leverage.
- Task 5 (NFR3 spot-check): VERDICT "no new perceptual defect
  attributable to TF32." Commander reported "audio still had gaps" —
  the gaps are the SAME Story 18.1-pinned producer-cadence gaps, not a
  new TF32-induced artifact. Lossless-TF32 promise (~1e-4 matmul drift)
  holds. No NFR7 architecture-layer routing required.

**Bundled-smoke gate (Task 6) — DEFERRED.**
Per OQ #4 + the OQ #3 (a) routing: Commander handles the bundled smoke
+ the build_tools/installer.iss + build_tools/version.py increments
together in the next `build_release.bat` cycle as a separate
build-state commit. Risk surface is low (the new module is reachable
from main.py via a normal import; PyInstaller's import-graph analysis
discovers it without a hidden-imports entry). If the deferred bundled
smoke surfaces a packaging defect, route back to Story 18.2 follow-up
commit.

**Locked decisions (per OQ resolution):**
- OQ #1 (wire-up placement) → **inside `main()` after `setup_logging()`**.
  INFO breadcrumb lands in `myvoice.log` via the file handler.
- OQ #2 (cuda-unavailable tag schema) → **`device_capability="none"`
  string sentinel**. Schema uniformity for downstream parsers.
- OQ #3 (out-of-range speedup) → **(a) ship as-engaged**. Single-shot
  null + Story 18.1 ratio preservation; 18.3 + 18.4 are the named
  producer-bottleneck fix.
- OQ #4 (build-counter increment files) → **out-of-scope** to this
  story's commits per Story 18.1 precedent. Commander handles them in
  a separate build-state commit when bundled smoke completes.

**Why the 15 new test_torch_runtime tests instead of 6–8:** the spec
estimated 6–8 tests; the parametrized tag-schema test (Task 3.5)
expanded to 5 parametrized rows covering Ampere 8.9, Blackwell 10.0,
Hopper 9.0, pre-Ampere Turing 7.5, and cuda-unavailable. The
idempotency contract (Task 3.4) split into two scenarios
(pre-set-True + back-to-back-from-cold) because the bug class is
"second call observable side-effect," and both scenarios stress
distinct mutation paths through the function.

**Compute-capability docstring fix (post-capture):** original docstring
listed "Blackwell = 10.0 (RTX 50xx, B100)" — this conflates datacenter
B100/B200 (CC 10.0) with the GeForce RTX 50xx (CC 12.0 per Commander's
RTX 5090 measurement). Updated to enumerate both variants with a note
that NVIDIA's major-version assignment is not strictly chronological.
Functionally irrelevant — `>= 8` gate engages either way — but worth
recording for future architecture-mapping audits.

**Test sweep totals:**
- Task 7.1–7.4 sweep: 86/86 PASS
- Task 7.5 broader sweep: 152/152 PASS (159 unique tests; some overlap
  between sweeps — net new from this story = 15 + 2 = 17 tests)
- Combined unique new tests in this story: 17 (15 in test_torch_runtime
  + 2 in test_progressive_playback_csv_capture)

**Next step (Task 8):** run `/bmad-bmm-code-review` on a different LLM
per the established Stories 16.7 / 16.8 / 17.1 / 17.2 / 17.3 / 18.1
pattern. Task 8 will be checked off in the resulting code-review fix
commit (Story 18.1's Task 7 precedent).

**Code-review pass (Task 8) — closed 2026-05-09 by claude-opus-4-7[1m].**

Findings (4 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM + 4 LOW = 11 total). All HIGH + MEDIUM auto-fixed:

- **H1 — deviation-marker drift on Tasks 4.2 + 4.3.** `[x]` overstates
  completion for spec-deviated work (single-shot N=1 vs N=10; implicit
  OFF baseline vs git-checkout-OFF). Markers changed to `[ ] **DEVIATION**`
  prefix so the surface checkbox honestly reflects routing-closure-not-
  spec-completion. Body text retains the OQ #3 (a) routing detail.
- **H2 — deferred-marker drift on Task 6 + 6.1-6.4.** All `[x]` despite
  entirely DEFERRED. Markers changed to `[ ] **DEFERRED**` prefix. AC #8
  explicitly remains unmet at story closure (Commander handles in next
  build cycle).
- **H3 — misleading comment in `torch_runtime.py:180-183`.** Comment
  claimed `is_ampere_or_newer()` "handles the cuda.is_available() guard"
  but the function does NOT call it (re-implements inline). Comment
  rewritten to reflect actual flow: re-implementation avoids two
  `get_device_capability()` round-trips.
- **H4 — `__all__`-pin regression in two sibling tests** (missed by
  Story 18.2's Task 7 sweep). `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_codec_token_streamer.py:46`
  and `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_streaming_decoder.py:98`
  pin the exact `__all__` list. Story 18.2 widened `__all__` with two
  new entries but didn't update these legacy pins. Both tests updated
  with declaration-order entries for the new exports. **This finding
  was not in the initial review enumeration — surfaced by running the
  broader test sweep post-edit.**
- **M1 — wire-up exception scope at `main.py:351`.** `except Exception`
  too broad vs spec text "try / except ImportError discipline."
  Tightened to `(ImportError, OSError)` matching the existing torch-import
  block at `main.py:44-49`. Other exception types now surface to main()'s
  outer handler so a genuine startup defect cannot hide.
- **M2 — `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark` docstring overpromise.**
  Returned dict was claimed to support "main.py logging actionable
  detail" but main.py discarded the return. Docstring rewritten to
  reflect the dict's actual purpose (test surface for assertion of the
  four hardware truth-table branches).
- **M3 — `_DEFAULT_FILENAME` naming-rot.** `"18-1-instrumentation-rtx5090-longform.csv"`
  was misleading because the capture file now spans Stories 18.1 + 18.2
  (and will serve 18.3 + 18.4). Renamed to story-agnostic
  `"progressive-playback-instrumentation.csv"`. Two pinning tests
  updated. Story 18.1's canonical baseline at `_bmad-output/...` is
  preserved (different directory tree; no overwrite risk).
- **L1, L2, L3, L4** — tracked as "Review Follow-ups (AI)" subsection
  under Tasks/Subtasks; left for a future commit.

**Test sweep post-fix:**
- `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/ + tests/unit/observability/` →
  164/164 PASS (was 162 + 2 fail before H4 fix).
- Broader Story 18.1+18.2 sweep (qwen_tts_service dispatch + session
  integration + observability + app-progressive-playback + integration
  test_progressive_playback_dispatch_skip + true_stream_callback +
  true_stream_instrumentation) → 158/158 PASS, zero regressions.

**Status:** `review` → `done` (HIGH + MEDIUM all fixed; LOW tracked as
follow-ups; AC #5 + AC #8 closure remain Commander-routed per OQ #3 (a)
+ OQ #4 routing accepted PRIOR to this code-review pass).

**Locked decisions (per OQ resolution):**
- OQ #1 (wire-up placement) → **inside `main()` after `setup_logging()`**.
  INFO breadcrumb lands in `myvoice.log` via the file handler.
- OQ #2 (cuda-unavailable tag schema) → **`device_capability="none"`
  string sentinel**. Schema uniformity for downstream parsers.
- OQ #3 (out-of-range speedup) → **route to Commander** rather than
  dev-agent interpretation. Evidence-file §4.4 has the tabulated
  surface ready for Commander's call.
- OQ #4 (build-counter increment files) → **out-of-scope** to this
  story's commit per Story 18.1 precedent. Commander handles them in a
  separate build-state commit when bundled smoke completes.

**Why the 15 new test_torch_runtime tests instead of 6–8:** the spec
estimated 6–8 tests; the parametrized tag-schema test (Task 3.5)
expanded to 5 parametrized rows covering Ampere 8.9, Blackwell 10.0,
Hopper 9.0, pre-Ampere Turing 7.5, and cuda-unavailable. The
idempotency contract (Task 3.4) split into two scenarios
(pre-set-True + back-to-back-from-cold) because the bug class is
"second call observable side-effect," and both scenarios stress
distinct mutation paths through the function.

**Test sweep totals:**
- Task 7.1–7.4 sweep: 86/86 PASS
- Task 7.5 broader sweep: 152/152 PASS (159 unique tests; some overlap
  between sweeps — net new from this story = 15 + 2 = 17 tests)
- Combined unique new tests in this story: 17 (15 in test_torch_runtime
  + 2 in test_progressive_playback_csv_capture)

### File List

**New (source tree):**
- `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py` (~95 LOC; docstring
  CC mapping updated post-capture to record Blackwell DC=10.0 and
  GeForce=12.0 variants)

**Edit (source tree):**
- `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/__init__.py` (re-export the two new symbols)
- `src/myvoice/main.py` (wire-up inside `main()` after `setup_logging()`)
- `src/myvoice/observability/progressive_playback_csv_capture.py`
  (Task 4.1: add `first_chunk_latency_ms` to `_CAPTURED_METRIC_NAMES`;
  docstring updated)

**New (tests):**
- `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py` (15 tests)

**Edit (tests):**
- `tests/unit/observability/test_progressive_playback_csv_capture.py`
  (`test_only_targeted_metrics_are_captured` updated to capture
  `first_chunk_latency_ms`; new `test_first_chunk_latency_row_columns_match_header`;
  code-review pass M3: two existing tests `test_default_path_for_value_1` +
  `test_env_var_one_creates_default_file_and_returns_stop` updated to
  match the renamed `_DEFAULT_FILENAME`)
- `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_codec_token_streamer.py`
  (code-review pass H4: `test_package_all_lists_expected_symbols_in_order`
  updated to include the two new Story 18.2 exports — fixes a
  pre-existing test failure introduced by Story 18.2's `__all__`
  widening but missed by Story 18.2's Task 7 sweep)
- `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_streaming_decoder.py`
  (code-review pass H4: `test_package_all_lists_expected_symbols_in_declaration_order`
  updated identically to test_codec_token_streamer.py)

**Edit (run scripts):**
- `01_Run_MyVoice_With_CSV_Capture.bat` (repointed CSV target to
  Story 18.2 path so Story 18.1 baseline at
  `18-1-instrumentation-rtx5090-longform.csv` is preserved as the
  implicit TF32-OFF reference; docstring + procedure updated for
  Story 18.2 single-shot smoke; pre-launch instructions to clear
  `logs/myvoice.log` so the breadcrumb is unambiguously from the run)

**New (evidence + measurement artifacts):**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-tf32-cudnn-benchmark-enable-evidence.md`
  (force-add per Story 16.9 / 17.1 / 17.2 / 17.3 / 18.1 evidence-file
  precedent; closed with the captured single-shot data + (a)-routing
  decision)
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-2-rtx5090-tf32-on.csv`
  (force-add; single-shot N=1 capture from 2026-05-09 19:23 — TF32 ON,
  11 chunks + 1 first_chunk_latency record; documented at evidence
  file §4.2)

**Reused (no edit):**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-1-instrumentation-rtx5090-longform.csv`
  (Story 18.1's existing baseline; serves as implicit TF32-OFF
  reference for the producer-cadence comparison at evidence file §4.3)

**Sprint-status update:**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
  (`18-2-tf32-cudnn-benchmark-enable: ready-for-dev` → `in-progress` →
  `review`)

**Out-of-scope uncommitted (per Story 18.1 precedent + OQ #4):**
- `build_tools/installer.iss` (build counter — pre-existing modification at conversation start)
- `build_tools/version.py` (build counter — pre-existing modification at conversation start)
  These will be re-incremented when Commander runs the deferred Task 6
  `build_release.bat` cycle. Not Story 18.2 feature work; Commander
  handles them in a separate build-state commit.

**Not modified by this story:**
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture-optimization-pass.md`
  (per Epic 18 framing `:234`: "No new D-decisions"; D-9 / NFR1 /
  NFR3 / NFR7 / NFR12 all preserved verbatim)
- `requirements.txt`, installer-spec, `build_release.bat` (per Epic
  18 framing `:248`: "18.1–18.3 are pure source-tree edits")

<!--
Dev agent: when populating the File List on closure, follow the Story 18.1 precedent
of explicitly segregating in-scope edits from out-of-scope uncommitted files. At
conversation start, `git status` showed two pre-existing modified files left over
from prior bundle-verification runs:
  - `build_tools/installer.iss` (build counter increment)
  - `build_tools/version.py` (build counter increment)
Story 18.1's File List flagged these as "out-of-scope uncommitted files surfaced by
git status and noted (not Story 18.1 source-tree edits)". Task 6 (bundled smoke) will
likely re-increment these. Either roll the increments into this story's commit (with
a clear note that the increments are build-counter-only, not feature work) OR call
them out under the same "out-of-scope" header Story 18.1 used and let Commander
decide. Do NOT silently include them in the main commit body without a callout.

## Open Questions for Dev Agent (deferred per workflow guidance)

> All four OQs resolved at story start; see "Locked decisions" in Dev
> Agent Record → Completion Notes List + §1 of the evidence file. Kept
> verbatim below for audit trail.

1. **Wire-up placement choice (Task 2 + AC #4):** module-level (immediately after the `import torch` block at `main.py:42-49`) vs. inside `main()` (immediately after `setup_logging()` returns at `main.py:334-region`). Module-level is structurally simpler but the INFO log from the enable function fires before `setup_logging()` configures the file handler — it would land on stderr only. Inside `main()` after `setup_logging()` is the cleaner placement for the log-line breadcrumb to land in `myvoice.log`. **Recommended:** inside `main()` immediately after `setup_logging()` returns. Confirm with Commander before locking the placement.
   **RESOLVED 2026-05-09**: inside `main()` after `setup_logging()` (recommended path confirmed by Commander).

2. **`device_capability` tag schema for the cuda-unavailable branch (AC #3 + Task 3.5):** Should the metric tag be `device_capability="none"` (string sentinel) or omit the tag entirely on the cuda-unavailable branch? **Recommended:** include the tag with value `"none"` for schema uniformity (downstream parsers see the same tag set on every record); document the sentinel at the function docstring. Confirm with Commander if a different sentinel (e.g., `"cpu"` or `null`) is preferred.
   **RESOLVED 2026-05-09**: include `device_capability="none"` (recommended sentinel confirmed by Commander).

3. **Out-of-range first-chunk-latency speedup (Task 4.4 + AC #5):** if the measured median speedup on the RTX 5090 falls outside the Epic 18 stub's anticipated [10%, 30%] range, route to Commander rather than dev-agent interpretation. Below 10%: probably "ship anyway because the cost is zero" but Commander confirms. Above 30%: probably "great, document and continue" but worth confirming the measurement isn't confounded by warm-vs-cold cache, GPU thermal state, qwen_tts model variant, or which Sarira-F quality cache state from Story 17.2 is in play. Surface the captured data + a confounder-checklist for Commander to act on.
   **TRIGGERED 2026-05-09**: single-shot capture showed inter-chunk-emit median of **6515 ms ON vs 6362 ms OFF (−2.4% slowdown, well outside [10%, 30%] anticipated range)**. Confounders documented at evidence file §4.4 (cuDNN autotune cold cost, N=1 vs N=1 noise, GPU thermal/driver state, Story 18.1 ratio essentially preserved at 3.29× ≈ 3.21×). Routed to Commander per OQ #3 with three options: (a) ship as-engaged + move to 18.3, (b) re-run N=10 + git-checkout OFF baseline for full statistical rigor, (c) revert wire-up. Recommendation: (a). Awaiting Commander.

4. **Build-counter increment files (`build_tools/installer.iss` + `build_tools/version.py`):** these were already modified at conversation start (leftover from prior `build_release.bat` runs); Task 6's bundled smoke will re-increment them. Roll into this story's commit with a "build-counter-only, not feature work" note, OR keep them out-of-scope per Story 18.1's precedent? **Recommended:** out-of-scope per the Story 18.1 precedent — they aren't Story 18.2 feature work; let Commander handle them in a separate build-state commit when the bundled smoke completes. Confirm before the closing commit.
   **POLICY LOCKED 2026-05-09**: out-of-scope per Story 18.1 precedent (recommended path). The two files stay un-touched by this story's commits; Commander rolls a separate build-state commit when bundled smoke (Task 6) completes.
