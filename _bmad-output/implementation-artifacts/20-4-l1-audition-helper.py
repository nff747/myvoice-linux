"""Story 20.4 AC #5 - NFR3 perceptual audition helper (Windows-only).

Walks Commander through a blinded A/B audition of the chunk-size retune.
Seven utterances, three short / two medium / two long, all on the CLONED
Sarira-F voice, all rendered through the production TRUE_STREAM path so the
streamer's chunk boundaries, the decoder's overlap-add and the consumer's
crossfade are all in the signal.

ROUNDS
------
Round 1 (``20-4-perceptual-fixtures/``) FAILED: m-020 was clean at
chunk_size=25 and carried ``tonal_distortion`` at chunk_size=10. Its
fixture, truth table and results CSV are preserved unchanged - that round
is a recorded result, and round 2 reuses its cs25 files verbatim as the
reference arm so the two rounds share a calibration anchor.

Round 2 (``20-4-perceptual-fixtures-r2/``) auditioned the seam fix at
chunk_size=10 and FAILED worse than round 1 - three blocking rows, and the
defect class changed from tonal_distortion to click_or_discontinuity. It
also conflated two variables (geometry AND stitching), so its clicks could
not be attributed.

Round 3 (``20-4-perceptual-fixtures-r3/``) isolated the stitching: both arms
chunk_size=25, reference pre-fix, candidate with the seam fix. It PASSED -
the fix was cleaner on both long fixtures and never worse - which settled
that the fix is good and the geometry was what failed at cs10.

Round 4 (``20-4-perceptual-fixtures-r4/``, the default) isolates the
GEOMETRY. Both arms carry the seam fix:
    reference = chunk_size 25 + fix   candidate = chunk_size 15 + fix
cs15 sits between the two geometries already judged (1.7x the reference's
seams here, against cs10's 2.5x), and Story 20.1 measured 1,157 ms TTFA
there. Note the reference is REGENERATED at cs25+fix rather than reused
from round 1 - round 1's files are pre-fix and would reintroduce the
two-variable confound round 2 died of.

All 14 round-4 files were loudness-normalised to equal active-speech RMS
after generation. Level is not the variable under test, and the raw takes
happened to differ by 8 dB on s-022.

Which side of each pair is which is recorded in the truth table ``_meta``
block, and the helper only consults it when unblinding at the end.

Pass a round as the second CLI argument (``r1``/``r2``) to re-run an
earlier round.

Commander solo is the protocol AC #5 specifies - it mirrors the Story
18.1 / 18.2 discipline, not Story 17.1's three-listener packet. This
change alters chunk stitching on every generation, which is a defect class
a single trained listener can adjudicate; it does not alter timbre or
dynamics, which is what needed multiple ears in 17.1.

VERDICT GATE (AC #5, and it is BLOCKING, not advisory):
    FAIL if any chunk-boundary artefact is flagged on a B/cs10 trial -
    clicks, discontinuities, or altered prosody at stitch points. A defect
    flagged on BOTH renditions is a pre-existing property of the pipeline,
    not a Story 20.4 regression, and is recorded as such rather than
    blocking.

Blinding: the script does not print which geometry is playing. The
truth-table in the fixture directory randomises A/B per utterance from a
fixed seed, so the mapping is reproducible from the generator but not
inferable from listening order.

Re-running is safe: rows already recorded for the same listener are
skipped. To restart, delete the rows from the CSV first.
