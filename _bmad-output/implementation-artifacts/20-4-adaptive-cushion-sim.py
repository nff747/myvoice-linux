"""Story 20.4 AC #2 / AC #3 - re-derive the adaptive cushion against the
SHIPPED StreamingChunkBuffer, before and after the Story 20.4 policy, at
both chunk geometries.

This is the direct successor to ``20-1-adaptive-cushion-sim.py``. Same
technique - drive the production class with an injected clock and synthetic
chunk arrivals at a chosen producer rate P, and report WHICH escape released
playback and at what offset from the first chunk. No GPU, no model.

Three things it establishes that the story asks for:

  1. AC #2 - a sub-16 GiB host now starts materially sooner than the 10 s
     ``MAX_PRE_DELAY_SECONDS`` guardrail, and the guardrail is no longer the
     binding escape anywhere on the sweep.
  2. AC #3 - the AC #2 fix holds AT chunk_size = 10, not merely at 25. Story
     20.1 SS2.7 found the coupling ran the wrong way: at cs10 the shipped
     policy's cushion-to-talker ratio WORSENED from 2.50x to 4.00x, because
     the talker segment shrinks while the cap does not.
  3. The product trade, quantified: total silence is conserved (a cushion
     second not spent up front reappears as a gap second later), so the
     choice is only about WHERE the silence lands.

The pre-20.4 policy is reproduced by subclassing the shipped buffer and
restoring its old ``_cushion_decision`` body, so both columns come out of the
same driver. The legacy column is cross-checked against Story 20.1 SS2.7's
published table at the bottom of this file - if the reproduction drifts, the
run says so rather than quietly reporting a wrong baseline.

Usage:
