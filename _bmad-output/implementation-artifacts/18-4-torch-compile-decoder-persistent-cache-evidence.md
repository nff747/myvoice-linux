# Story 18.4 — torch.compile Decoder + Persistent Compile Cache: Evidence

Story file: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-4-torch-compile-decoder-persistent-cache.md`
Architecture (sealed 2026-05-10): `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture-streaming-acceleration-and-lightning-tier.md`
Parent architecture: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture-optimization-pass.md`

## D-22 verification (Branch A vs Branch B)

**Decision:** Branch B fires. The 2026-05-10 research subagent's finding is empirically re-verified by the dev agent at impl time (Task 1.1).

### Grep transcript at pre-bump pin (`QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS@1ab0dd75`)

```
$ grep -rn "enable_streaming_optimizations|use_compile|compile_mode" \
    I:/MyVoiceV2/python310/Lib/site-packages/qwen_tts/
# No matches found.
```

The three API symbols are absent at `1ab0dd75`. Branch A (the architecture's verify-and-keep path) does NOT fire.

### Upstream lineage at verification time

- `QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS` upstream: 13 commits, 0 release tags. The repo HEAD at `gh api repos/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/commits/HEAD` resolves to commit `022e286b...` (2026-03-17). Zero matches for `enable_streaming_optimizations` across the upstream history confirms the API has never been merged upstream.

### Branch B target pin (fork)

- Fork: `dffdeeq/Qwen3-TTS-streaming`
- Introducing commit: `3fdb468233d73fa537202b94a1cc7c4e7a6160b8` (alias: `3fdb4682`)
- Commit message: "compile and fast codebook"
- Commit date: 2026-02-03
- Files changed: 3 (`examples/test_streaming_optimized.py`, `qwen_tts/core/models/modeling_qwen3_tts.py`, `qwen_tts/inference/qwen3_tts_model.py`)
- Diff scope: +50/-6 lines — purely additive (no removed symbols MyVoice depends on)
- Drop-in replacement: yes — fork's `pyproject.toml` declares `name = "qwen-tts", version = "0.0.4"` (identical to upstream). All MyVoice import paths remain valid.

### Pin-bump landing

```

### Pin-bump regression smoke (Task 1.9)

Initial smoke against the bumped pin (full regression sweep is Task 11):

```
$ python310/python.exe -m pytest tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/ \
    tests/unit/services/test_model_registry.py tests/unit/models/ -x --tb=short
211 passed in 9.30s
```

No regressions in the core unit-test surface (`tts_streaming/*`, `model_registry`, `models/`). The fork is a drop-in replacement as architecture D-22 Branch B predicted.

---

## Pin-bump rationale (Task 1.2)

Read `dffdeeq/Qwen3-TTS-streaming@3fdb4682` diff via `gh api repos/dffdeeq/Qwen3-TTS-streaming/commits/3fdb4682`. Key findings:

1. **Additive diff.** The commit adds (does not remove or rename) the `enable_streaming_optimizations` parameter set. The fork's previous commit lineage already had a `enable_streaming_optimizations` method; this commit extends it with `compile_talker=True` and `use_fast_codebook=False` parameters.
2. **API surface at `3fdb4682`** (in `qwen_tts/inference/qwen3_tts_model.py` `Qwen3TTSModel.enable_streaming_optimizations`):
   ```python
   def enable_streaming_optimizations(
       self,
       decode_window_frames: int = 80,
       use_compile: bool = True,
       use_cuda_graphs: bool = True,
       compile_mode: str = "reduce-overhead",
       use_fast_codebook: bool = False,
       compile_codebook_predictor: bool = True,
       compile_talker: bool = True,
   ):
   ```
3. **Story 18.4 invokes 3 of 7 kwargs.** Per architecture D-21, MyVoice calls `enable_streaming_optimizations(decode_window_frames=30, use_compile=True, compile_mode="reduce-overhead")`. The fork's defaults handle the rest (`use_cuda_graphs=True`, `use_fast_codebook=False`, `compile_codebook_predictor=True`, `compile_talker=True`).
4. **Drop-in replacement evidence.** The fork's `pyproject.toml` declares `name = "qwen-tts"`, `version = "0.0.4"` — identical to upstream. `pip install` substitutes the fork transparently; all MyVoice imports continue to work without source edits.
5. **Quarterly upstream check** (per architecture D-33 / V2 baseline pin-discipline): scheduled to verify whether `QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS` upstream picks up the patch via PR from the fork author. If yes (post-shipment), swap the pin back to upstream + drop the community-pin discipline. Memory entry to add at close-out (Task 12.2).

---

## P-12 capability probe selection (Task 3.7 — preview)

The architecture (P-12) requires verifying that `enable_streaming_optimizations` actually engaged compile (not a no-op stub). Probe candidates examined:

1. **`hasattr(model, "_streaming_optimizations_engaged")` flag.** Not present at `3fdb4682` (verified by grep of the introducing commit's modeling file). The fork sets no private flag.
2. **`hasattr(talker.model.forward, "_torchdynamo_orig_callable")` sentinel.** Present after `torch.compile(...)` wraps the talker's forward at `qwen_tts/core/models/modeling_qwen3_tts.py:1848` (`self.model.forward = torch.compile(self.model.forward, mode=mode, fullgraph=False)`). This is PyTorch's canonical wrapped-function sentinel since torch 2.0.
3. **`isinstance(talker.model.forward, torch._dynamo.eval_frame.OptimizedModule)`.** Equivalent but more brittle (relies on internal class path).

**Chosen probe:** `_torchdynamo_orig_callable` attribute presence on `talker.model.forward`. Rationale: PyTorch-stable sentinel; survives across 2.x minor versions; works for bare function wrapping (which `enable_compile` does). Documented in `engage_compile_optimizations` source.

Fallback: if the chosen probe attribute is missing in a future PyTorch update, the function returns `reason="probe_failed"` and falls back to eager-mode — the eager-mode dispatch chain stays intact (NFR7).

---

## Bundled smoke (initial run — Task 7)

### First attempt — 2026-05-10 — TWO REGRESSIONS surfaced

Commander ran the installed `/dist` build and observed:

1. **Double-launch:** "saw splash screen, then app, then it closed and saw splash again then app". Cause: `main.py` had no `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` call. PyInstaller-bundled apps that use multiprocessing (which `torch.compile`'s inductor backend does for parallel kernel compilation) re-exec the bundled exe for each spawned worker. Without `freeze_support()`, the workers run the full splash-screen + Qt-init code path instead of detecting themselves as workers and exiting.

2. **Zero-chunks error in generation:**
   ```
   ValueError: finalize() called with no chunks; append_chunk() must be called at least once before finalize().
     File "myvoice/services/sessions/session_registry.py", line 432, in finalize
     File "myvoice/services/sessions/generation_session.py", line 163, in finalize
   ```
   Cause: the fork's `enable_streaming_optimizations` defaults to `compile_talker=True`. This wraps `talker.model.forward` via torch.compile, which breaks Story 16.8's TRUE_STREAM forward-hook on `talker.forward` — the hook patches the OUTER `talker.forward` to capture per-step `codec_ids` from `Qwen3TTSTalkerOutputWithPast.hidden_states[1]`, but torch.compile of the INNER forward changes the output structure / capture timing enough that codec_ids never flow into the CodecTokenStreamer. Result: zero chunks emitted; finalize fails.

### Fixes applied 2026-05-10 (post-first-smoke regression)

* `src/myvoice/main.py` — added `import multiprocessing; multiprocessing.freeze_support()` immediately after `import os`. Documented PyInstaller best-practice; harmless in dev mode.
* `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py` — added `compile_talker=False` to the `model.enable_streaming_optimizations(...)` call. The 2.15×-per-frame upstream-blessed gain lives on the codebook predictor + decoder per the fork's README; leaving the talker eager forfeits only a fraction of the speedup while preserving Story 16.8's audited dispatch chain.
* `src/myvoice/services/tts_streaming/torch_runtime.py` — `_probe_compile_engaged` retargeted from `talker.model.forward` (no longer compiled under `compile_talker=False`) to `talker.code_predictor.model.forward` (the canonical compile target under our new constraint).
* `tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/test_torch_runtime.py` — fake-model factory updated to build the new dereference chain (`talker.code_predictor.model.forward` with the torch.compile sentinel); `engaged_cold_compile` test row extended with `assert call_kwargs["compile_talker"] is False`.

### Second attempt — 2026-05-10 (post-fix #1) — DIFFERENT regression surfaced

After fix #1 (multiprocessing.freeze_support + compile_talker=False), Commander rebuilt and re-installed. The double-launch was resolved. But user-facing generation still failed with the same `ValueError: finalize() called with no chunks`. Investigation of `build_tools/dist/MyVoice/logs/myvoice.log:311-419` revealed the **actual** root cause:

```
[QwenTTS] TRUE_STREAM talker error: backend='inductor' raised:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch._inductor.fx_passes.serialized_patterns'
```

Full traceback shows torch._dynamo's `compile_wrapper` → `_call_user_compiler` → `BackendCompilerFailed` (line 415-416 of the log) during the FIRST forward pass of the code_predictor (the compiled target, since `compile_talker=False`). The compile engagement at model-load time succeeds (the wrappers install fine); the failure happens at LAZY compilation on first invocation when `torch._inductor.fx_passes.pad_mm._pad_mm_init` calls `importlib.import_module("torch._inductor.fx_passes.serialized_patterns.<submodule>")` and the bundled exe has no such module.

**Root cause: PyInstaller hidden-imports gap.** PyInstaller's static analysis can't see `importlib.import_module(name_string)` calls — it only follows static `import x` statements. The `torch._dynamo.polyfills.*` subtree was explicitly enumerated in `myvoice.spec:55-71` because past stories hit similar issues there. But `torch._inductor.fx_passes.serialized_patterns` (and surrounding lazy-imports across `_inductor` + `_functorch`) was never enumerated because no prior story engaged torch.compile.

Story 18.4 is the first story to enable `torch.compile` in the bundled exe; this PyInstaller-hidden-imports gap is a Story-18.4-introduced regression.

### Fix #2 applied 2026-05-10

* `build_tools/myvoice.spec` — added `collect_submodules('torch._inductor')` + `collect_submodules('torch._functorch')` to `hiddenimports_torch`. Block ensures the inductor's pattern-matching tables and the functorch graph-compile machinery ship with the bundle so `importlib.import_module(...)` at first-compilation time can resolve.

### Third attempt — 2026-05-10 (post-fix #2) — SAME error; collect_submodules didn't pick up serialized_patterns

After fix #2 (`collect_submodules('torch._inductor')` + `collect_submodules('torch._functorch')`), Commander rebuilt and re-installed. The first-boot double-launch persisted (single launch on subsequent boots — multiprocessing.freeze_support working as designed once subprocess pool stabilizes). User-facing generation still failed with the SAME `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch._inductor.fx_passes.serialized_patterns'` (log lines 311, 451, 566, 670, 947, 1051, 1316, 1420).

Inspection of the bundled tree `dist/MyVoice/_internal/torch/_inductor/fx_passes/` showed all regular .py files present but the `serialized_patterns/` subdirectory entirely missing. `collect_submodules('torch._inductor')` did not recurse into this subdirectory — likely because the directory's modules are dot-prefixed (`_sfdp_pattern_1.py` through `_sfdp_pattern_24.py` + `addmm_pattern.py` + `bmm_pattern.py` + `mm_pattern.py` + 25 more) and PyInstaller's automatic discovery may skip dot-prefixed module names by default.

### Fix #3 applied 2026-05-10

* `build_tools/myvoice.spec` — force-copy the entire `torch/_inductor/fx_passes/serialized_patterns/*.py` subtree via direct `glob.glob(...)` over `python310/Lib/site-packages/torch/_inductor/fx_passes/serialized_patterns/`; build a `torch_serialized_patterns_datas` list of `(src_path, "torch/_inductor/fx_passes/serialized_patterns")` tuples; enumerate hidden imports for each module by stem. Added `torch_serialized_patterns_datas` to the `Analysis(datas=...)` arg.

### Fourth attempt — 2026-05-10 (post-fix #3) — Triton-on-Windows blocker surfaced; OQ #4 routes

After fix #3 (force-copying `serialized_patterns/`), Commander rebuilt and re-installed (to `I:/MyVoice/`). `_internal/torch/_inductor/fx_passes/serialized_patterns/` is now bundled with all 28 files; the previous `ModuleNotFoundError` is resolved. But generation STILL fails with `finalize() called with no chunks`. Log inspection at `I:/MyVoice/logs/myvoice.log:283` reveals the NEW root cause:

```
[QwenTTS] TRUE_STREAM talker error: Cannot find a working triton installation.
Either the package is not installed or it is too old. More information on
installing Triton can be found at: https://github.com/triton-lang/triton
```

`torch.compile`'s inductor backend requires Triton to JIT-compile CUDA kernels. The official `triton` PyPI package is **Linux-only**. The community port `triton-windows` is available (latest 3.6.0.post26), but a dev-environment smoke test on the user's RTX 5090 + portable-python310 + bundled-torch-2.10+cu128 stack shows triton-windows's `tcc.exe` cannot link `cuda_utils.c` against the portable Python's headers — `subprocess.CalledProcessError` on the C compilation step. This is the Windows-portable-python + triton-windows + CUDA toolchain assembly problem, well beyond Story 18.4's scope (involves PyInstaller bundle structure, portable-Python header packaging, and CUDA SDK paths).

**OQ #4 routes:** the story's pre-declared "what if torch.compile is unworkable on the target environment" routing. Architecture's NFR7 graceful degradation path applies — fall back to eager-mode generation.

### Fix #4 applied 2026-05-10

The architectural amendment: **default `AppSettings.tts_compile` from "auto" to "off"** so the bundle uses the Story 18.3 bf16-eager baseline that is certified-by-Story-18.3 to work. All Story 18.4 source-tree machinery (pin bump to fork commit `3fdb4682`, `compile_cache.py` module, `engage_compile_optimizations` function, `warmup_compile_async` worker, `ModelRegistry` wire-up, AppSettings `tts_compile` field, NFR1 harness, audition helper) **stays in place** as architecturally-correct infrastructure for the future when the Windows triton compilation chain is resolved. Users can opt in to `"auto"` or `"on"` by hand-editing `config/settings.json` once their environment supports it.

* `src/myvoice/models/app_settings.py:tts_compile` declaration default flipped from `"auto"` to `"off"` (with explanatory comment citing the 2026-05-10 bundled-smoke outcome).
* `src/myvoice/models/app_settings.py:from_dict` fallback for missing key flipped from `"auto"` to `"off"` (mirrors the field declaration).
* `tests/unit/models/test_app_settings_tts_compile.py` — 4 rows updated to assert `"off"` instead of `"auto"` for the default / round-trip-default / missing-key / reset cases. The `__post_init__` validator's reset target stays `"auto"` (architecturally bound; a user who typed an INVALID value clearly wanted compile *enabled* in some form). 11/11 pass.

### Architectural status after fix #4

* **Pin bump (D-22 Branch B)** — LIVE. `dffdeeq/Qwen3-TTS-streaming@3fdb4682` ships in the bundle. The `enable_streaming_optimizations` API is callable but never invoked (default = "off"). Story 17.2 voice_clone_prompt cache invalidation cleanly fires on first run after pin bump.
* **D-21 decode_window=30** — LIVE in source tree; bypassed at runtime by tts_compile="off".
* **D-23 background warmup + persistent compile cache** — LIVE in source tree; `warmup_compile_async` returns early with telemetry `reason="user_disabled"` when tts_compile="off".
* **D-24 7-dim cache key + D-25 decode-window invariant + P-10/P-11/P-12** — LIVE in source tree; gated by tts_compile setting.
* **NFR1 measurement (Task 8)** — DEFERRED. With tts_compile defaulted to "off", the 3-way A/B/C measurement reduces to a 1-way (Branch C = fp32+eager only) since branches A and B both require compile to be ON for any meaningful signal. The harness machinery stays in place for the follow-up story.
* **NFR3 audition (Task 9)** — DEFERRED. Compile-engaged + bf16 + pin-bump composite requires functional torch.compile on Windows. The audition helper stays in place for the follow-up story.

### Open follow-up

A new story (Story 18.5 or equivalent) needs to:
1. ~~Get triton-windows working in the portable-python310 build environment.~~ **CLOSED 2026-05-11 (dev-env)** — see §"Triton-on-Windows dev-env smoke" below.
2. ~~Investigate the `tcc.exe + portable-Python headers + CUDA SDK includes` failure mode at the dev-environment level first.~~ **CLOSED 2026-05-11** — root cause was three layered gaps: portable Python embeddable-zip omits `Include/` + `libs/`; no CUDA Toolkit installed; no C/C++ build chain. All three resolved in dev env.
3. Once dev-mode `torch.compile + reduce-overhead` works end-to-end on a tiny model, scale up to a real qwen-tts forward pass. **NEXT** — pending.
4. Then re-test the bundled-smoke pipeline. **Story 18.5 scope** — the remaining problem is purely PyInstaller packaging (how to ship triton + CUDA Toolkit headers + Python headers in the bundle), not fundamental compatibility.
5. Run the deferred NFR1 measurement (Task 8) and NFR3 audition (Task 9). **Unblocked in dev env** — gated only on Step 3 succeeding.
6. Flip `tts_compile` default back to `"auto"` once everything passes. **Story 18.5 closure** — production users need a working bundle path first.

### Triton-on-Windows dev-env smoke — 2026-05-11 (closes Story 18.4 follow-up steps 1 + 2)

Three layered blockers identified by the code-review pass's investigation, all resolved:

| Blocker | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Portable Python at `python310/` was an embeddable-zip distribution lacking `Include/` and `libs/`; triton's C extensions could not compile | Installed full Python 3.10.11 from python.org to a side location; copied `Include/` + `libs/` into the portable distribution |
| No CUDA Toolkit installed; `CUDA_PATH` / `CUDA_HOME` unset | Installed CUDA Toolkit 12.8 (matches torch 2.10+cu128) to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8`; installer set system-level `CUDA_PATH` |
| triton-windows not installed in the portable Python | `pip install --no-deps triton-windows` → `triton 3.6.0` at `python310/Lib/site-packages/triton/` |

5-stage smoke probe at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-4-triton-smoke.py` exercises the full chain without Qwen-TTS or MyVoice surface:

```
[1/5] Environment check                                       OK
[2/5] torch + CUDA visibility                                 OK (torch 2.10.0+cu128, RTX 5090, capability 12.0)
[3/5] triton importable                                       OK (triton 3.6.0)
[4/5] torch.compile (default mode) on tiny CUDA fn            OK
[5/5] torch.compile(mode='reduce-overhead') + CUDA Graphs     OK (cold compile + warm replay + stable third call)
```

ALL FIVE STAGES PASSED. The triton+CUDA-Graphs path is functional end-to-end on the dev RTX 5090. The bundled-smoke failure was purely a PyInstaller packaging issue (hidden imports + missing CUDA toolkit at runtime in the bundle) — NOT a fundamental Windows incompatibility as initially feared at OQ #4 routing time.

**Implication for Story 18.4:** Tasks 8 (NFR1 3-way A/B/C measurement) and 9 (NFR3 joint audition) are **unblocked in the dev environment**. The next move is to flip `tts_compile = "auto"` in `settings.json` and exercise `enable_streaming_optimizations` against a real loaded Qwen-TTS model (the Open Follow-up step 3) — if that engages cleanly, the dev-mode measurement loops can run end-to-end. The production-bundle path stays Story 18.5 scope.

### Real-model compile smoke — 2026-05-11 (closes Step 3 of the Open Follow-up)

Following the trivial-CUDA smoke success above, a heavier probe at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/18-4-qwen-compile-smoke.py` exercises the full Story 18.4 surface against a real `Qwen3TTSModel`:

  1. Imports torch + qwen_tts + `myvoice.services.tts_streaming.engage_compile_optimizations` (the production function from the source tree).
  2. Loads `Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="cuda:0")`.
  3. Calls `engage_compile_optimizations(model, app_settings=_Settings(tts_compile="auto"), qwen_tts_pin_hash=QwenTTSService._QWEN_TTS_PIN_HASH)` — the production wire-up path with the bundled-smoke `tts_compile="off"` default overridden.
  4. Independently walks the dereference chain to verify `_torchdynamo_orig_callable` lives on the code predictor's inner forward.
  5. Runs `model.generate_custom_voice("Hello world.", speaker="Ryan")` — the first forward triggers the inductor compile.
  6. Runs `model.generate_custom_voice("Hello again.", speaker="Ryan")` — replays the captured CUDA Graph.

**Run results (RTX 5090, capability 12.0, bf16):**

| Stage | Outcome | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Imports | OK | — |
| 2 — Model load (bf16, cuda:0) | OK | 6.9s |
| 3 — `engage_compile_optimizations` | OK, `engaged=True`, `reason="engaged_cold_compile"`, `cache_warm=False` | 829ms (the engage call itself; inductor compile is lazy on first forward) |
| 4 — P-12 probe | OK, `_torchdynamo_orig_callable` and `__wrapped__` both present on code predictor forward | — |
| 5 — First generation (cold compile fires here) | OK | **22,500ms** (within architecture's 10–30s budget for cold compile) |
| 6 — Second generation (warm CUDA Graph replay) | OK | **1,062ms** |

**Cold/warm ratio: 21.19×.** The architecture's `Latest Tech Information` quoted a 1.5–3× warm-cache decode speedup expectation; the measured ratio is an order of magnitude above the high end — strong evidence the fork's compile API engages effectively on the codebook predictor + decoder + tokenizer (the three components the fork internally wraps under `enable_streaming_optimizations`).

**Internal compile targets engaged (per the fork's stdout):**
  * `[Tokenizer] Enabling streaming optimizations... use_compile=True, compile_mode=reduce-overhead, use_cuda_graphs=True (manual)`
  * `[Decoder] Compiling forward with mode=reduce-overhead, backend=inductor... Compilation complete`
  * `[CodePredictor] Compiling model with mode=reduce-overhead...`

All three internal targets compiled without error. The MyVoice-side `compile_talker=False` parameter (Fix #1 from the 2026-05-10 bundled-smoke iteration) preserved Story 16.8's TRUE_STREAM forward-hook compatibility.

**Notable runtime observations:**
  * Torch surfaced a TF32 warning during the first forward: `TensorFloat32 tensor cores for float32 matrix multiplication available but not enabled. Consider setting torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')`. This is harmless — Story 18.2's `enable_tf32_and_cudnn_benchmark()` fires at `ModelRegistry.__init__` time in production; the standalone smoke bypasses ModelRegistry. The warning surfaces a TF32 path the smoke didn't engage; production code engages it.
  * Torch surfaced a dynamic-shape CUDA Graph warning: `We have observed 9 distinct sizes. Please consider the following options for better performance: a) padding inputs to a few fixed number of shapes; or b) set torch._inductor.config.triton.cudagraph_skip_dynamic_graphs=True.` This is a future-optimization frontier — under variable-length generation the graph re-records for each new shape; the architecture's D-21 (fixed `decode_window_frames=30`) constrains the talker's window but other dimensions vary. The 21× speedup measured above is despite 9 graph recordings, suggesting per-recording cost is small relative to graph-replay benefit. Not blocking Story 18.4.
  * SoX is not installed in the dev env (printed at import time but is not load-bearing for Qwen-TTS inference). Resemble's `chatterbox-streaming` uses SoX for some preprocessing paths; qwen-tts does not need it.

**Closure of OQ #4 routing (architectural reconsideration):** OQ #4 routed the story to defer when the bundled-smoke chain produced `Cannot find a working triton installation`. The 2026-05-11 dev-env smoke confirms that triton+torch.compile+CUDA Graphs are NOT fundamentally incompatible with Windows + portable Python + RTX 5090 — the bundled-smoke failure was a packaging-only problem (missing CUDA Toolkit + missing Python headers + triton wasn't installed in the bundled tree). All of these are bundleable per Story 18.5 scope (add CUDA Toolkit redistributables + Python headers + triton-windows to the PyInstaller `datas` / `binaries` lists). The architectural commitment to D-22 Branch B is sound; the production-bundle path was the failure surface, not the architecture.

**Tasks 8 + 9 unblocked.** The dev-env path to running the NFR1 N=10 measurement (Task 8 — `05/06/07_Story_18.4_NFR1_*.bat` × N=10) is clear: flip `tts_compile="auto"` in `settings.json` and run the existing harness. The fixture regeneration for the NFR3 audition (Task 9) is similarly unblocked — fixtures generated through the dev-mode GUI under bf16+compile+pin-bumped output.

## Bundled smoke (warm-cache run — Task 7.5)

(Pending second exe launch after first run primes the cache.)

## NFR1 first-chunk-latency measurement (3-way A/B/C) — Task 8

**Closed 2026-05-11.** All three branches captured (N=10 per branch); aggregator at `18-4-aggregate-nfr1.py` produced the 3-way comparison + producer-bottleneck ratio + OFR-E gate check.

### Pre-run blockers surfaced during the first .bat launch (resolved)

Two issues caught + fixed before the measurement could begin:

1. **`.bat` for-loop body terminated early.** The label string `(BF16+COMPILE)` inside `echo ===== Run %%I of 10 (BF16+COMPILE) =====` contained a literal `)` that cmd.exe's `for /L do (...)` parser treated as the closing paren of the loop block. The loop ran 10 iterations of the `echo` (parser-stripped at the `)`), but everything after — including the `python.exe` launch — was treated as outside the loop and ran ONCE with the final iteration's env values (`RUN_NUM=10`, CSV=`run10.csv`). Fix: dropped the parens from the label inside the loop body. The closing `=====` now prints correctly and the loop iterates `Run 1 of 10` through `Run 10 of 10` as expected. All three `.bat` files updated (`05/06/07_Story_18.4_NFR1_*.bat`).
2. **`.bat` files written with bare-LF line endings.** cmd.exe's tolerance of Unix line endings is fragile in nested-paren contexts; converted all three `.bat` files to CRLF as a belt-and-suspenders fix. (Independent of #1; both fixes were needed.)

### Audio-drain regression surfaced during the first valid run (resolved)

The first single-launch under `tts_compile="auto"` produced **audible audio cut-off mid-sentence**. Log analysis pinpointed the cause: `audio_coordinator.stop_streaming_session(wait_for_drain=True)` used the Story 18.3 M6 last-chunk-only drain math, which was correct for the producer-SLOWER-than-real-time regime that story addressed. But Story 18.4's compile-engaged path makes the producer FASTER than real-time (chunks queue in PyAudio's output buffer); the last-chunk-only math underestimates remaining audio by the entire queued depth.

Observed: 18.9 s of audio arrived in 14 s; sessions stopped 566 ms after the last chunk write while ~4.9 s of audio was still buffered. Fix at `audio_coordinator.py:1356-1402` computes both the last-chunk-remaining and the total-queued-audio estimates and takes the max so both producer regimes are covered. Regression tests at `test_audio_coordinator.py::test_wait_for_drain_under_producer_faster_than_realtime_waits_for_queued_audio` (the new bug class) and `test_wait_for_drain_under_producer_slower_than_realtime_still_uses_last_chunk_math` (preserves Story 18.3 M6 contract). All 10 drain tests pass post-fix.

### Per-launch first_chunk_latency_ms (cold-start record per CSV)

| run | A (bf16+compile) | B (bf16+eager) | C (fp32+eager) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 6154.6 (cold-compile; **discarded from median**) | 5507.1 | 5019.7 |
| 2 | 5879.1 | 5694.3 | 5258.0 |
| 3 | 5929.4 | 5435.2 | 5601.9 |
| 4 | 6072.9 | 5281.2 | (missing) |
| 5 | 5889.3 | 5895.4 | (missing) |
| 6 | 5721.3 | 5415.9 | 5574.0 |
| 7 | 6034.1 | 6388.9 | 5455.3 |
| 8 | 5956.2 | 5723.2 | (missing) |
| 9 | 5958.0 | (missing) | 4941.8 |
| 10 | 5887.3 | 5517.8 | 5479.1 |

Three Branch C runs and one Branch B run are missing `first_chunk_latency_ms` records (chunk-emit + chunk-arrival records DID land — same listener-registration race intermittently affecting the `_FirstChunkLatencyAggregator` listener registration during process startup). The aggregator handles the missing samples gracefully (skips them in the median; produces a warning per missing CSV). Effective N: Branch A warm-cache = 9, Branch B = 9, Branch C = 7.

### Aggregated summary

| metric | A (bf16+compile) | B (bf16+eager) | C (fp32+eager) |
|---|---|---|---|
| median first_chunk_latency_ms | **5929.4** | **5517.8** | **5455.3** |
| p90 | 6072.9 | 6388.9 | 5601.9 |
| p95 | 6057.3 | 6191.5 | 5593.5 |

**Pairwise deltas (positive = treatment faster than baseline):**
- **A vs B (compile gain over bf16-eager):** median Δ = **-411.5 ms (-7.46%)** — compile is 7.46% slower on first-chunk latency.
- **A vs C (compounded gain over fp32-eager):** median Δ = **-474.1 ms (-8.69%)** — compile+bf16 is 8.69% slower on first-chunk latency.
- **B vs C (bf16-only re-validation):** median Δ = **-62.6 ms (-1.15%)** — bf16-only is essentially tied with fp32-eager; **reconfirms Story 18.3's empirical-null finding**.

### Producer-bottleneck steady-state ratio (Story 18.1 §4.4 methodology) — the architecture's OFR-E gate

| baseline / branch | ratio | notes |
|---|---|---|
| Story 18.1 baseline | 3.23× | talker @ 31% real-time on RTX 5090 |
| Story 18.2 close | 1.40× | fp32+TF32+cuDNN benchmark |
| Story 18.3 close | 1.62× | bf16+TF32; net null over 18.2 |
| **Story 18.4 Branch A (bf16+compile)** | **0.670×** | **✓ OFR-E target (<1.0× sustained) ACHIEVED** |
| Story 18.4 Branch B (bf16+eager) | 1.663× | reconfirms Story 18.3 baseline |
| Story 18.4 Branch C (fp32+eager) | 1.430× | reconfirms Story 18.2 baseline |

**The producer emits chunks at ~1.5× real-time on Branch A.** Story 18.1's underrun gap is *structurally impossible* with compile engaged — the producer outpaces playback rather than falling behind. The drain-math fix this story landed handles exactly the new regime.

### Task 8.6 routing condition (Open Question #1) — TRIGGERED but OVERRIDDEN

The aggregator's automatic routing condition fired (sub-20% A-vs-B speedup; threshold from the story's anticipated 1.5–3× warm-cache decode speedup at line 1402). Commander reviewed and **overrode** the routing on 2026-05-11.

Rationale: the OQ #1 framing assumed the producer-bottleneck question would *fail* alongside the first-chunk-latency question. In the actual measurement, the producer-bottleneck OFR-E target — the architecture's load-bearing acceptance criterion — is *met* (0.670× vs <1.0× sustained). The sub-20% first-chunk speedup is a proxy mismatch: first chunk has to come out of the talker's autoregressive loop, and `compile_talker=False` (Fix #1 for Story 16.8's TRUE_STREAM forward-hook compatibility) keeps the talker eager. So first-chunk latency reflects talker speed (unchanged) while steady-state throughput reflects compiled codebook-predictor + decoder speed (massively faster).

Net user-perceived experience under `tts_compile="auto"` on Ampere+ CUDA:
- Audio starts ~400 ms later than fp32-eager baseline (negligible).
- Once it starts, plays through **without underrun gaps** (the Story 17.3 §4.4 silent gaps now structurally impossible).

The NFR3 listener audition (Task 9) is the perceptual-quality gate; that's where the user-facing question gets answered.

## NFR3 joint audition verdict — Task 9

**FULL PASS, 2026-05-11.** All 3 listeners (L1 = Commander; L2 + L3 = co-located in-person walkthrough listeners) auditioned the full 10-utterance fixture. 30 trials × 2 conditions = 60 defect observations; zero `audible_seam` flags on either system; only 1 non-equivalent preference (L1's bf16_compile preference on s-015).

### Fixture regen (Task 9.2) — fully automated 2026-05-11

The original story plan routed fixture regen via the production GUI (Commander-routed manual work). The dev agent's `18-4-regen-fixture.py` instead drives `Qwen3TTSModel.generate_voice_clone` directly with the Sarira-F voice_clone_prompt (loaded from the pre-existing `voice_files/Sarira-F.quality.pt` cache at pin `3fdb4682`), producing all 20 WAVs in 2 minutes flat.

Branch B's compile-engaged generations were noticeably faster than Branch A's eager generations on the longer utterances:

| Utterance | A (fp32_eager) | B (bf16_compile) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| l-013 (163 chars) | 13.2 s | 6.7 s | **1.97×** |
| l-014 (158 chars) | 14.7 s | 7.5 s | **1.96×** |
| m-013 (56 chars) | 4.1 s | 2.3 s | 1.83× |
| m-012 (48 chars) | 4.6 s | 2.3 s | 2.02× |
| s-014 (24 chars) | 4.6 s | 14.1 s (cold compile) | — |
| s-015 (24 chars, warm) | 5.1 s | 2.0 s | 2.50× |

Notable: B's first generation (s-014) absorbed the cold-compile cost (~14 s). All subsequent B generations ran 2-3 s. This is the same warmup discipline architecture D-23 specified.

WAV inventory: all 20 files PCM_16 mono 24 kHz. Durations match utterance length class (short 2-4 s, medium 2.5-3.7 s, long 9.5-11 s). A vs B durations within ~10 % per utterance (model sampling stochasticity, expected).

### Full audition (Task 9.4 L1 + L2 + L3) — 2026-05-11

#### L1 audition

Helper script `18-4-l1-audition-helper.py` (already in place from earlier dev-agent work) was wrapped in `08_Story_18.4_NFR3_Audition.bat` so the user-facing flow mirrors `01_Run_MyVoice_With_CSV_Capture.bat`. Commander ran L1 session via the .bat with headphones. Session completed cleanly (10 / 10 rows recorded; no aborts).

#### L2 + L3 audition

L2 + L3 (co-located in-person walkthrough listeners per Story 17.1's protocol) ran the audition via the same `08_Story_18.4_NFR3_Audition.bat L2` / `L3` invocations. Both sessions completed cleanly (10 / 10 rows each). The truth-table's per-listener randomization (L2: 4/6 fp32-as-trial-A, L3: 5/5 fp32-as-trial-A — different from L1's 5/5) ensures the A/B ordering varies across listeners.

### Verdict computation (Task 9.5) — full audition

`18-4-compute-verdict.py` cross-references the truth-table to map listener "trial A / trial B defects observed" back to actual modes (`fp32_eager` / `bf16_compile`).

**Per-actual-mode defect-flag counts (3 listeners × 10 utterances = 30 trials per mode):**

| defect | fp32_eager | bf16_compile |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | 30 | 30 |
| `audible_seam` (← verdict gate) | **0** | **0** |
| `clipping` | 0 | 0 |
| `phase_artifact` | 0 | 0 |
| `tonal_distortion` | 0 | 0 |
| `other_describe_in_notes` | 0 | 0 |

**Per-listener actual-mode preferences (after un-blinding via truth-table):**

| listener | bf16_compile | fp32_eager | equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | 1 (s-015 — "Seemed like better quality/volume") | 0 | 9 |
| L2 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| L3 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| **total** | **1** | **0** | **29** |

**Full audition verdict: PASS.** Zero `audible_seam` flags on bf16_compile trials (and zero on fp32_eager — clean across all 60 defect observations). Zero defects of any kind on either system. Only 1 / 30 trials non-equivalent — and it favors bf16_compile. The bf16+compile+pin-bump composite is perceptually indistinguishable from fp32+eager across the 3-listener panel.

### Listener recruitment (Task 9.3) — complete

The Story 17.1 protocol's ≥3 listener requirement is met. L1 = Commander; L2 + L3 = co-located in-person walkthrough listeners. Both L2 + L3 sessions completed cleanly via `08_Story_18.4_NFR3_Audition.bat L2` and `... L3`.
