# Story 16.9 — NFR1 Reconciliation Report

> **Outcome:** (c) pure contract revision. No production code change.
> **Verdict-driving data point:** GPU SENTENCE_STREAM phase-profile (Story 16.9 Task 2, n=50) shows `_generate_sync` accounts for **99% of first-chunk wallclock**; the 3B `quality` model has a **~1.2s per-utterance floor** on RTX 5090 + qwen-tts 0.0.4; the 0.6B `small` tier is **~2× slower** on Blackwell (Story 16.9 Task 3.2 reversal — falsifies model-tier-penalty hypothesis).
> **Streaming-default flag flip status:** unblocked. Conjunction-block (Story 16.8 + Story 16.9) cleared 2026-05-08. Remaining prerequisite: multi-listener perceptual A/B audition (future "streaming default ramp" story).

## 1. Executive summary

Story 16.7's empirical-validation harness produced a two-failure verdict on 2026-05-08 (`16-7-streaming-validation-report.md` §1, §3.2, §5): TRUE_STREAM was structurally broken (closed by Story 16.8) AND SENTENCE_STREAM did not meet NFR1's 2-second first-audio ceiling on either GPU or CPU. Story 16.9 was created as the contract-level unblocker for the streaming-default flag flip — to either (a) fix the SENTENCE_STREAM implementation, (b) ship a model-tier fallback policy, or (c) formally revise NFR1.

Story 16.9 chose **outcome (c) pure contract revision**. Rationale: phase-decomposition profiling on the maintainer's RTX 5090 + qwen-tts 0.0.4 host showed `_generate_sync` (the `model.generate_custom_voice` invocation site) accounts for ≥99% of first-chunk wallclock; `_split_text_for_streaming`, registry `post_mutation`, and chunk-delivery overhead are individually ≤0.1% of total. The 3B `quality` model has a ~1.2s per-utterance floor for any input regardless of length. A targeted small-tier (0.6B) comparison run produced an unexpected reversal: the smaller model is **~2× slower** than the 3B `quality` tier on Blackwell, so outcome (b) "model-tier fallback" is ruled out. Hypothesis (c) "sentence-split granularity" was partially confirmed (length-latency Pearson r = +0.915) but the implementation-fix path has structural ceiling well above NFR1 (the 1.2s model floor cannot be removed by splitter changes) AND introduces voice-quality regression risk that requires audition coverage (deferred per Story 16.7 §6.1).

The architecture document was amended in two places (`architecture-optimization-pass.md:802` cell pointer + new prose sub-section at line 819). The revised NFR1 specifies per-class targets (short ≤5.0s p95, medium ≤10.0s p95, long informational, CPU exempted) that empirical Story 16.9 data clears. The streaming-default flag flip's remaining prerequisite is the deferred multi-listener perceptual A/B audition.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Phase-profiling instrumentation choice

Subtask 1.1 chose **option (a1)** — extension of `scripts/validate_streaming_default.py` with a `--profile-phases` flag — over (a2) authoring a sibling profiler. Net new lines in the harness: **+461 / -17 = +444 net new lines** per `git diff --stat` (PhaseProfile dataclass, `_profile_phases` context manager, four new argparse flags, conditional CSV-column writing, per-class per-phase aggregate printer, stratified-sample selector). The initial draft estimate was "~280 net new lines"; the figure was corrected post-commit by the code-review pass (see story Change Log #4 / L1). The (a1) line count exceeds the story's 50-line guideline; (a2) was rejected because it would require duplicating ~200 lines of harness boilerplate (DLL preamble, environment capture, mock audio coordinator, request builder, async main loop, argparse). The phase profiling is logically a superset of the harness's existing scope, and (a2) duplication tax > (a1) growth tax.

The instrumentation patches three call surfaces from harness-side via a per-utterance context manager:

- `service._split_text_for_streaming` → records `split_seconds` (phase a)
- `service._generate_sync` (first call only) → records `generate_seconds` (phase b; merged with phase c per AC #1 L3 default)
- `service._session_registry.post_mutation` (filtered to mutation_type `'append_chunk'`, first call only) → records `deliver_seconds` (phase d)
- `service._model_registry.ensure_model_loaded` (first call only) → records `model_load_seconds` (added in Subtask 1.5; see §2.2)

Patches are bound-method shadows on the instance and are restored on context exit; production code at `qwen_tts_service.py:2028-2242` is unchanged.

### 2.2 Subtask 1.5 dry-run finding: the model-load phase

The Subtask 1.5 1-utterance dry run revealed that the original four-phase decomposition (split / generate / decode / deliver) accounted for only ~17% of utterance #1's first-chunk wallclock. The missing ~83% was inside `await self._model_registry.ensure_model_loaded(...)` at `qwen_tts_service.py:2143-2146` — the cold model load on the harness's first invocation (~3-7s for the 3B model). Subsequent utterances hit the cache (~µs). A fifth phase column `model_load_seconds` was added to the profiler before the Task 2 full run; with this column the AC #1 phase-sum-vs-total sanity check holds for **every** row (max gap < 0.3% across all 70 measured rows in Tasks 2 + 3.2 + 6).

### 2.3 Hypothesis-falsification protocol

Each of the four hypotheses from Story 16.7 §1's recommendation was settled with one of:
- **Confirmed** (data supports)
- **Falsified** (data contradicts)
- **Consistent** (data does not contradict but does not directly verify)
- **Residual** (silent on this hypothesis; leftover after the others are settled)

Per AC #2, "at least one hypothesis must end in a state other than 'we should look into this someday'." This story exceeds that bar: hypothesis (b) is decisively **falsified with reversal** (the small tier is slower than the quality tier on Blackwell — the opposite of what the hypothesis predicts).

### 2.4 Stratified-sample CPU protocol

Per AC #4 / Subtask 6, the CPU baseline run used `--stratified-sample 4:4:2` (4 short + 4 medium + 2 long = 10 utterances) with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` set on the GPU host. An initial attempt with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` (empty string) left torch in a degenerate state where CUDA was nominally available but no device was usable; the harness's `_resolve_gpu_name` caught the exception and labeled the rows `unknown_cuda_device`. The retry with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` produced a clean CPU run (`gpu_name=cpu` for all 10 rows). The error-state initial-attempt CSV was overwritten by the retry; only the retry's data is committed.

## 3. Phase-profile results

### 3.1 GPU SENTENCE_STREAM (n=50; `16-9-gpu-sentence_stream-phase-profile.csv`)

Per-class per-phase aggregates (s-001 warmup outlier dropped from short class for hypothesis-(c) regression; included for phase-share and aggregate counts elsewhere):

| Class | n | split p95 | model_load p95 | generate p95 | decode p95 | deliver p95 | first_chunk p95 |
|-------|---|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| short | 17 | 0.0000s | 0.7296s¹ | 4.18s² | 0.0000s | 0.0001s | 4.18s² |
| medium | 17 | 0.0000s | 0.0000s | 8.74s | 0.0000s | 0.0001s | 8.74s |
| long | 16 | 0.0000s | 0.0000s | 25.23s | 0.0000s | 0.0001s | 25.23s |

> **¹** The `model_load p95 = 0.7296s` for short class is a numpy-default linearly-interpolated p95 across 17 rows where 16 are ~9 µs (cache hit) and 1 (s-001) is 3.65s (cold load). Statistically correct but practically bimodal — typical first-utterance model_load on a warm process is ~µs, cold-start is ~3.65s once.
>
> **²** The short-class `first_chunk p95` cell is the same 4.18s as `generate p95` because in this report's framing the user-facing first-chunk latency is the steady-state per-utterance dispatch cost, with cold model load amortized once per session (not paid per request). Strictly numerical disambiguation: `first_chunk_latency_seconds` p95 (n=17, includes s-001 with model_load+generate=4.79s) = **4.93s**; `first_chunk_latency_seconds` p95 (n=16, drop s-001) = **4.26s**; `generate_seconds` p95 (n=17) = **4.18s**. All three pass the new ≤5.0s short-class target adopted by Story 16.9 outcome (c). For medium/long classes the columns are equivalent because cold model load contributes only to s-001. (Disambiguation added by code-review pass — see story Change Log #4 / M1.)

Aggregate phase share across all 50 valid rows: **generate=99.0%** / model_load=1.0% / split=0% / decode=0% / deliver=0%. Phase-sum vs first_chunk_latency_seconds sanity check: median gap ≤ 0.02% across all classes (within 5% threshold ✓).

**Dominant phase: phase b (`generate_seconds`)** by an overwhelming margin. The `_generate_sync` body's invocation of `model.generate_custom_voice(text=..., language=..., speaker=..., instruct=...)` (qwen-tts 0.0.4's `Qwen3TTSForConditionalGeneration.generate` at `qwen_tts/core/models/modeling_qwen3_tts.py:2022-2292`, including talker generate + speech_tokenizer.decode) accounts for ≥99% of first-chunk wallclock on RTX 5090. There is no second dominant phase.

### 3.2 GPU SENTENCE_STREAM small-tier (0.6B) comparison (n=17 short-class; `16-9-gpu-sentence_stream-small-tier-comparison.csv`)

Loaded via `--quality-tier small` flag on the harness, which calls `service._model_registry.set_quality_tier("small")` after service start (mutates only the in-memory registry; no AppSettings disk write). The 0.6B `small` tier is loaded fresh on utterance #1 (cold load 26s — likely partial download); utterances 2-17 hit the cache.

| Tier | n | generate p50 | generate p95 | NFR1 (<2s) clearance |
|------|---|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `quality` (3B; Task 2) | 16 | 1.84s | 4.18s | 9 / 16 |
| `small` (0.6B; Task 3.2) | 17 | 3.13s | 7.94s | 0 / 17 |

**Reversal:** the smaller model is approximately 2× slower in the steady-state inference body. Plausible explanations include fewer optimized kernels for the smaller architecture on Blackwell, less-optimized attention paths, or different kernel selection at fp16/bf16. Whatever the cause, the empirical signal is unambiguous: switching to the 0.6B model would make first-audio worse on this hardware. Outcome (b) "model-tier fallback" is **ruled out**.

### 3.3 CPU SENTENCE_STREAM stratified (n=10; `16-9-cpu-sentence_stream-stratified.csv`)

| Class | n | model_load p95 | generate p95 | first_chunk p95 |
|-------|---|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| short | 4 | 1.85s | 5.40s | 5.40s + load |
| medium | 4 | 0.0000s | 7.85s | 7.85s |
| long | 2 | 0.0000s | 22.37s | 22.37s |

Aggregate phase share: generate=97.1% / model_load=2.9% / others ≤0.1%. The CPU phase decomposition mirrors the GPU finding: `_generate_sync` is the dominant cost on both hardware classes. The CPU's 5.40s short-class p95 is roughly comparable to GPU's 4.18s — the CPU on this host (32+ logical cores) is competitive with GPU for short-class inference, which is unusual but consistent with the small-batch / single-utterance nature of the workload.

`mode_dispatched` for every CPU row was `sentence_stream` — but **see story Change Log #4 / M2**: with `--mode-override sentence_stream` the harness invokes `service._generate_streaming(request)` directly, bypassing the public `_dispatch_by_streaming_mode` path that emits `streaming_mode` / `streaming_mode_fallback` metrics. `_classify_dispatched_mode` therefore falls through to `dispatched = requested` for every row, so the "no-fallback" observation is true *by construction* rather than empirically verified by Story 16.9's harness runs. The D-9 / NFR12 hardware-aware-default invariant is verified in production by the dispatch-chain unit tests at `tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_dispatch.py` (unchanged), not by this harness run.

## 4. Hypothesis verdicts

### 4.1 Hypothesis (a) qwen-tts version drift — **CONSISTENT (upstream-bound, not directly verified)**

Settling data point: phase b (`generate_seconds`) accounts for ≥99% of total wallclock across 50 GPU rows + 10 CPU rows. The `_generate_sync` body's only meaningful work is the `model.generate_custom_voice` call into qwen-tts 0.0.4's wrapper. If a previous qwen-tts version (the one the architecture-projection era assumed) had materially-faster `Qwen3TTSForConditionalGeneration.generate`, the regression to 0.0.4 would be sufficient explanation for the contradicted "~1.5–1.8s estimated" projection. A direct previous-version comparison is **out of scope** for Story 16.9 (would require checkout of an older requirements pin + a separate venv). The verdict is therefore "consistent (upstream-bound but not directly verified)" — the data is compatible with hypothesis (a) but does not prove it.

### 4.2 Hypothesis (b) 3B-quality vs 0.6B-small tier penalty — **FALSIFIED (with reversal)**

Settling data point: `16-9-gpu-sentence_stream-small-tier-comparison.csv` row aggregates show small-tier short-class p95 generate = 7.94s vs quality-tier short-class p95 generate = 4.18s on the identical 17-utterance set. The smaller model is **~2× slower**, the opposite of the hypothesis's prediction. Outcome (b) "model-tier fallback" is structurally ruled out: switching to the 0.6B model would degrade NFR1 first-audio rather than improve it.

### 4.3 Hypothesis (c) sentence-split granularity — **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED**

Settling data point: cross-class Pearson r between `first_chunk_chars` and `first_chunk_latency_seconds` is +0.915 (n=49, s-001 warmup dropped); per-class r values are +0.77 / +0.66 / +0.68 for short / medium / long. The linear slope is ~+0.10 sec/char cross-class. Length materially correlates with latency.

But the implementation-fix path has **structural ceiling well above NFR1**:

- The shortest input "Hold on." (8 chars) generates in 1.265s — the minimum observed first_chunk_latency. Extrapolating the +0.17 sec/char short-class slope, the ≤2s NFR1 ceiling corresponds to ~12-char first chunks — too short for natural language without sub-clause splitting.
- 9/16 short-class utterances clear NFR1 in their current form; 7/16 do not (despite chunk-1 being the entire short utterance). Splitting cannot help these (no smaller chunk exists).
- For medium/long: aggressive comma-splitting could halve typical first-chunk char counts, reducing latency proportionally — but not enough to reach 2s, AND with voice-quality regression risk that requires audition coverage (Story 16.7 §6.1 deferred).

Per AC #3 decision rule, "(c) confirmed (even partially) → outcome (a) implementation fix (tighten the splitter, possibly hybrid with (c))." Story 16.9 deviates from the literal decision rule's outcome-(a) recommendation in favor of pure outcome (c) because the splitter fix's structural ceiling is above NFR1 and the voice-quality risk is unaudited; the cost of (a) outweighs the benefit (marginal latency improvement on a metric being revised). The deviation rationale is captured in §5 Outcome rationale and in `16-9-correct-course-nfr1-revision.md` §3.

### 4.4 Hypothesis (d) NFR1 was always optimistic — **CONSISTENT (residual not invoked because at least one other is settled)**

Settling data point: the architecture's "~1.5–1.8s estimated" projection (`architecture-optimization-pass.md:802`) was authored 2026-04-27 (per Story 16.7 §"Why this is the next entry point"); the qwen-tts pin was bumped to 0.0.4 (commit `1ab0dd75`) in Story 16.1. The empirical 1.2s `_generate_sync` floor + ~+0.10 sec/char slope on RTX 5090 means most realistic inputs exceed 2s; the original projection was optimistic on this hardware+pin. This verdict is **consistent** rather than residual because hypotheses (a) consistent and (c) partially confirmed already settle the contradiction; (d) is the over-arching framing rather than the residual.

## 5. Outcome rationale

**Verdict: outcome (c) pure contract revision. No production code change.**

The AC #3 decision rule's nominal recommendation given my hypothesis verdicts is "(c) confirmed even partially → (a) implementation fix possibly hybrid with (c)." Story 16.9 chose pure (c) over the (a)+(c) hybrid because:

1. **Structural ceiling.** The 3B model's 1.2s `_generate_sync` floor is upstream-bound. No splitter change can reduce it. The most aggressive splitter change (cap first-chunk at 12 chars) would still produce ~1.2s first-chunk latency for medium/long inputs — improvement over current 5-25s but still over NFR1's 2s.
2. **Voice-quality regression risk.** Sub-clause / mid-comma splitting introduces unnatural pauses. The audition gate (Story 16.7 AC #2's multi-listener A/B) is deferred to a future "streaming default ramp" story. Shipping a splitter change without audition coverage is a quality risk that the contract revision does not need.
3. **Marginal NFR1 progress.** The harness re-run with a comma-splitter would show *some* improvement on medium/long but would still produce a "FAIL" verdict against the original 2s ceiling. Outcome (a)'s after-fix CSV would be a story of partial improvement on a metric we are revising regardless.
4. **Cost-benefit asymmetry.** Outcome (a) cost: ~80-150 LoC + tests + harness re-run + voice-quality risk. Benefit: marginal NFR1 improvement on a metric being revised. Outcome (c) cost: ~zero (documentation-only). Benefit: clean contract that empirical data supports + unblocks the streaming-default flag flip.
5. **Story framing explicitly authorizes outcome (c).** Story file line 442: *"Outcome (c) is not a failure mode — it's a legitimate engineering verdict that the architecture's projection was wrong and the contract should be updated to reflect reality."*

The decision was routed through stakeholder sign-off via `/bmad-bmm-dev-story`'s `AskUserQuestion` prompt on 2026-05-08 (Commander as sole stakeholder per `memory/production_release_state.md`); the routing artifact is `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/16-9-correct-course-nfr1-revision.md`.

## 6. Implementation summary

**Production code change: zero.** No edits to `services/sessions/*`, `services/audio_coordinator.py`, `services/tts_streaming/*`, `services/qwen_tts_service.py` (production module unchanged), `models/app_settings.py`, `ui/dialogs/settings_dialog.py`, or any test file. The TRUE_STREAM dispatch chain (`_dispatch_by_streaming_mode` / `_generate_true_stream` / empty-chunks fallback chain), the SENTENCE_STREAM dispatch chain (`_generate_streaming` / `_split_text_for_streaming` / `_generate_sync`), and the BATCH dispatch are all preserved unchanged. NFR7 graceful-degradation chain holds. D-9 / NFR12 hardware-aware streaming default holds.

**Documentation changes:**

- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture-optimization-pass.md`:
  - Line 802 (NFR1 cell): brief inline pointer added — `*(Story 16.9 reconciled 2026-05-08 — empirical contradiction; per-class targets adopted. See follow-up note below.)*`
  - New prose sub-section `#### Story 16.9 Follow-up Note (NFR1 Reconciliation, 2026-05-08)` inserted between the OFR table (line 817) and the next `### Implementation Readiness Validation` heading (now line 861). The sub-section carries the empirical-contradiction table, phase-profile finding, hypothesis verdicts, revised NFR1 wording, streaming-default flag flip's remaining-prerequisite restatement, and source-artifact pointers.

- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/16-9-correct-course-nfr1-revision.md`: stakeholder routing artifact (the `/bmad-bmm-correct-course` deliverable equivalent for outcome (c) sign-off).

**Harness changes (committed):**

- `scripts/validate_streaming_default.py`: extended with `--profile-phases`, `--quality-tier`, `--stratified-sample`, `--output-csv-name` flags; new `PhaseProfile` dataclass; new `_profile_phases` context manager; new per-class per-phase aggregate printer. **+461 / -17 = +444 net new lines** per `git diff --stat` (the initial draft "~280" estimate was corrected post-commit by the code-review pass — see story Change Log #4 / L1). The Story 16.7 invocation paths are unchanged when none of the new flags are set.

**Committed CSVs (force-added via `git add -f`):**

- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/16-9-gpu-sentence_stream-phase-profile.csv` (50 rows, 20 columns; Task 2)
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/16-9-gpu-sentence_stream-small-tier-comparison.csv` (17 rows; Task 3.2)
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/16-9-cpu-sentence_stream-stratified.csv` (10 rows; Task 6)

## 7. CPU dimension

The CPU stratified sample (n=10, 4 short + 4 medium + 2 long; `16-9-cpu-sentence_stream-stratified.csv`) confirms that CPU SENTENCE_STREAM also fails the original 2s NFR1 ceiling across all classes (short p95=5.40s, medium p95=7.85s, long p95=22.37s). The CPU phase decomposition mirrors the GPU finding: generate=97.1% / model_load=2.9% / others ≤0.1%. `_generate_sync` is the dominant cost on both hardware classes; the bottleneck is upstream of the dispatch chain.

Per the revised NFR1, **CPU SENTENCE_STREAM is exempted from the streaming-NFR1 contract**; CPU users fall back to the V2 baseline. Hardware-aware default (D-9 / NFR12) ensures CPU users do not encounter TRUE_STREAM — verified in production by the dispatch-chain unit tests at `tests/unit/services/test_qwen_tts_service_dispatch.py` (unchanged), **not** by Story 16.9's harness runs (which use direct-dispatch via `--mode-override` and therefore bypass the metric-emitting public path; see §3.3 footnote and story Change Log #4 / M2). This formalizes what was already true in practice: Story 16.7 §5's CPU baseline was already over the 2s ceiling for non-trivially-short inputs; the original "CPU: meets via inherited SENTENCE_STREAM" framing was empirically optimistic.

The CPU verdict joins the GPU verdict: outcome (c) contract revision applies symmetrically, with the additional clause that CPU is structurally exempted (not subject to a per-class target) because CPU users are on the V2 baseline path.

### 8.3 Hardware reproducibility

The reported numbers depend on:

- **GPU model:** RTX 5090 Blackwell. Re-running on Ampere (RTX 30xx) or Ada Lovelace (RTX 40xx) is expected to be **slower** for SENTENCE_STREAM `quality` tier (the 1.2s floor is RTX-5090-specific; older architectures will have higher floor + slope). The Story 16.9 small-tier reversal (0.6B slower than 3B on Blackwell) may not hold on Ampere/Ada; if a future user on Ampere benchmarks the small tier and finds it faster, that is consistent with Blackwell-specific kernel selection patterns and does not invalidate Story 16.9's outcome (c) verdict on the maintainer's hardware.
- **CUDA toolkit:** v12.8 (cu128).
- **qwen-tts pin:** commit `1ab0dd75` = qwen-tts 0.0.4. A future qwen-tts release shipping a faster `Qwen3TTSForConditionalGeneration.generate` would invalidate the 1.2s floor finding; at that point the harness should be re-run against the new pin and outcome (a) reconsidered as a separate story.
- **CPU:** the maintainer's host is a 32+ logical-core x86_64 desktop (per `memory/hardware_setup.md`'s ship-target also covers RTX 30xx/40xx + 4GB-RAM-CPU configurations; the maintainer's CPU is well-resourced relative to the 4GB target). CPU SENTENCE_STREAM latency on a 4GB-RAM-CPU ship target host is expected to be **substantially slower** than the maintainer's 5.40s short-class p95 — the revised NFR1's "CPU exempted" clause covers the ship-target as well as the maintainer's host.

### 8.4 Software reproducibility

To re-run from scratch on a clean RTX 5090 + Win11 + bundled python310:

```cmd
git checkout epic-16
git pull
python310\python.exe -m pytest ^
    tests\integration\test_streaming_tts_smoke.py ^
    tests\unit\services\test_qwen_tts_service_dispatch.py ^
    tests\test_qwen_tts_internals.py
REM (expect Story 16.7 + 16.8 baseline test count; Story 16.9 added no new tests)
REM Then run the four commands in section 8.1.
```

Story 16.9 added no production tests because outcome (c) is documentation-only. Story 16.7's empty-chunks regression guard (`tests/integration/test_streaming_tts_smoke.py::TestSilentTalkerSurfacesAsFailure`) and Story 16.8's wire-up regression guard (`tests/integration/test_streaming_tts_smoke.py::TestTrueStreamWireUpEndToEnd`) are unchanged and remain the canonical guards against regressions in the streaming dispatch path.
