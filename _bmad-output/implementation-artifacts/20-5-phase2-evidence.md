# Story 20.5 — Phase 2 evidence (AC #3) + Phase 3 pre-registration (AC #4)

Date: 2026-09-01 · Host: RTX 5090 / Win11 / torch 2.10+cu128 / transformers 4.57.3
Model: Qwen3-TTS 12 Hz tokenizer, quality tier, `tts_precision="auto"` → **bf16**,
`tts_compile="auto"` → engaged.

Phase 1 evidence: `20-5-codec-state-caching-evidence.md`. This file covers the
production implementation and the audition that has not yet run.

**One variable.** Phase 2 carries codec state across chunk boundaries and does
nothing else. `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE` stays at 25, `DEFAULT_LOOKAHEAD` stays at 5,
the post-decode trim is unchanged, the Story 20.4 1,024-sample seam blend stays
in, and the 64-sample `StreamingChunkBuffer` crossfade stays in. Both smoothing
layers were **evaluated on evidence** (§4) and neither was changed.

## 1. What was implemented

`_build_true_stream_decode_fn` now returns a `StatefulCodecDecoder` in place of
the cold-state adapter, when three build-time gates pass. It re-walks
`Qwen3TTSTokenizerV2Decoder.forward`'s module traversal — calling the loaded
submodules' inner `nn.Conv1d` / `nn.ConvTranspose1d` directly — and threads one
per-session state object through every conv, transposed conv and the
transformer's KV cache. It subclasses nothing, patches nothing, copies no
weights and vendors no file, exactly as Phase 1 §3.3 predicted.

**The bias correction is carried.** `_stream_tconv` subtracts one copy of
`conv.bias` over the overlap region, because `nn.ConvTranspose1d` adds its bias
to every output position of each partial convolution. Phase 1 §1.1 recorded that
omitting it produces a 17–21 % residual that survives fp32 and reads exactly like
the NO-GO verdict. It is pinned by
`test_transposed_conv_bias_is_not_double_counted`, which runs the naive form
deliberately and requires it to be six orders of magnitude worse (§3.2).

### 1.1 The geometry, and the one asymmetry

The streamer emits `chunk_size + lookahead` = 30 frames per chunk and slides by
25, so chunk *k* covers frames `[25k, 25k+30)`. State must be committed at the
**splice** (frame `25k+25`), not at the end of the window, or chunk *k+1* would
resume five frames in its own future. `StatefulCodecDecoder.__call__` therefore
decodes in two passes: the first 25 frames with the live state, then a snapshot,
then the trailing 5 frames on the snapshot, then a restore.

The snapshot is **free** — O(1) tensor *references*, no copies. Every state slot
is reassigned rather than mutated in place, upstream included
(`DynamicSlidingWindowLayer.update` rebinds `self.keys` to a slice of a fresh
`torch.cat`), so holding the old references is a valid snapshot. That invariant
is pinned by a trip-wire
(`test_transformers_dynamic_cache_snapshot_contract_is_intact`), because if a
future transformers mutates in place the state would silently advance past the
splice and every chunk would skip 5 frames of audio.

Resulting identities, which the worker's splice arithmetic depends on:

| | first decode of a session | every later decode |
|---|---|---|
| decode length | `1920·N − 555` | **`1920·N`** |
| posted chunk | `25·1920 − 555` = 47,445 | **`25·1920`** = 48,000 |

The 555 does not shrink; it *moves* to the single stream-start call, which is
where the whole-sequence decode loses it too. Total for N frames is
`1920·N − 555` — identical to a single-shot decode, to the sample. Getting the
first splice wrong duplicates or drops 23 ms at the first seam of every
utterance and is invisible to every per-chunk check; that is the exact class of
defect Story 20.4 spent four audition rounds finding, and
`test_state_cached_stream_is_time_contiguous_through_every_seam` pins it.

### 1.2 AC #3's lifecycle requirement

State is strictly per session. One `CodecStreamState` per `StatefulCodecDecoder`
per dispatch; no module-level or class-level storage, so concurrent generations
via the HTTP API each get their own
(`test_state_is_per_instance_not_module_or_class_level` drives two decoders in
different orders and requires the second's output to be byte-identical to a
fresh one's).

`StreamingDecoderWorker` calls `decode_fn.reset()` at exactly the three points
the AC names:

| point | site |
|---|---|
| session start | `_run`, before the loop |
| completion | `_run`, on `END_OF_STREAM`, **before** the terminal post |
| cancel | `_drain_and_post_cancel`, after the drain, **before** the cancel post |

**The Story 16.5 cooperative-cancel chain is unaffected.** `_reset_codec_state`
never raises — it swallows and records `codec_state_reset_error` — precisely so
that a misbehaving reset cannot stop `('cancel', session_id)` reaching the
registry (P-7). `test_a_raising_reset_cannot_break_the_cancel_chain` installs a
reset that raises and requires the cancel post to happen anyway.
`test_codec_state_is_reset_on_cancel_before_the_cancel_post` pins the ordering.
No cancel-path control flow changed; the existing 20.4 cancel tests pass
unmodified.

### 1.3 Failure policy: decline loudly, never degrade silently

The wrapper restates upstream internals, so the only safe failure mode is to
decline and ship today's audio. Three build-time gates, any of which returns the
stateless adapter with a logged reason:

1. **Kill switch.** `MYVOICE_CODEC_STATE_CACHE=0`. Also how the Phase 3 fixture
   renders both arms from one build.
2. **Structural probe.** `probe_decoder` walks the whole module graph and
   refuses on: an unknown leaf type, a strided causal conv, a transposed conv
   whose kernel is neither `stride` nor `2·stride`, a non-sliding transformer
   layer, or a derived geometry that disagrees with `streaming_decoder`'s
   measured 1920 / 555. The unknown-leaf check matters most: without it a new
   time-mixing module would fall through the traversal's pointwise
   passthrough and corrupt audio at every boundary — a failure that is
   inaudible as a bug and audible only as "the codec got worse".
3. **Numerical self-test on the loaded weights** (§3.3), memoised per decoder
   object. In the shipping configuration the compile-priming generation at
   startup pays for it, so no user-visible generation does.

At runtime the length identity is re-checked on every chunk and a mismatch
raises rather than posting mis-spliced audio; and the worker's own
`decode_geometry_unverified` guard stays live on the new path
(`test_state_cached_geometry_violation_still_falls_back_and_says_so`).

### 1.4 One deliberate divergence from the stock path

`Qwen3TTSTokenizerV2Model.decode` truncates its output to
`(audio_codes[..., 0] > 0).sum(1) * decode_upsample_rate` — an encoder-side
heuristic for *padded batch* decode, where a zero code means padding. A
streaming chunk from the talker carries no padding, and Story 20.4 verified the
`1920·N − 555` identity on 14 independent residual lengths plus every full
chunk, so the clamp never fires. Replicating it would let a single legitimate
code-0 frame silently delete 1,920 samples of real speech mid-stream. The
wrapper does not replicate it. Recorded here rather than in a commit message.

---

## 2. Does the shipped path reconstruct the codec's true output?

Measured by `20-5-phase2-verify.py`. Ground truth is `decoder(codes)` over the
whole captured token sequence. Both arms are driven through a **real**
`StreamingDecoderWorker` with the real splice and the real overlap-add, from the
**same** captured token chunks, so the only difference is the decode.

Reference = stateless (ships today). Candidate = state-cached.

### 2.1 Length

| utterance | frames | chunks | ground truth | stateless Δ | state-cached Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| l-020 | 231 | 10 | 442,965 | +0 | **+0** |
| l-021 | 176 | 7 | 337,365 | +0 | **+0** |
| m-020 | 44 | 2 | 83,925 | +0 | **+0** |

Both arms total correctly — Story 20.4's splice fix already ensured that. Length
was never the remaining defect; alignment and content were.

### 2.2 Content

| | l-020 | l-021 | m-020 |
|---|---|---|---|
| whole-signal NRMSE vs ground truth — **stateless** | 2.08e-01 | 6.03e-01 | 1.63e-01 |
| whole-signal NRMSE vs ground truth — **state-cached** | **9.88e-03** | **1.02e-02** | **7.91e-02** |
| improvement | 21× | 59× | 2.1× |

m-020's 7.9e-02 is not a state-carrying residual: its per-chunk profile is
`[0.106, 0.008]` — the error is in **chunk 0**, which is decoded from a genuinely
cold state on *both* arms because it is the start of the stream. m-020 opens
near-silent ("She sells seashells…"), so NRMSE against a low-RMS reference reads
high. Its error-by-position profile (§2.4) is flat, which is the rounding
signature, not the cold-start one.

### 2.3 Seam fidelity — the Story 20.4 measurements, repeated

First 1,024 samples after each seam (the blend width), median over seams:

| | head NRMSE | correlation med / min | lag delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **stateless** l-020 | 0.406 | 0.928 / 0.732 | +0 … +368 |
| **state-cached** l-020 | **0.0078** | **1.0000 / 0.9937** | **+0 … +0** |
| **stateless** l-021 | 0.477 | 0.888 / 0.811 | +0 … +114 |
| **state-cached** l-021 | **0.0075** | **1.0000 / 0.9999** | **+0 … +0** |
| **stateless** m-020 | 0.220 | 0.985 / 0.985 | +1 … +1 |
| **state-cached** m-020 | **0.0055** | **1.0000 / 1.0000** | **+0 … +0** |

Against Story 20.4's reference points (~35 % NRMSE, 0.55 median / 0.11 min
correlation, ±35 samples of lag jitter): head error falls **50–60×**, correlation
reaches 1.0000 on every seam of every utterance, and **lag jitter is exactly
zero on every seam** — the streamed audio is sample-aligned with what a
single-shot decode would have produced.

### 2.4 Error by position into the chunk — the regime discriminator

RMS error / ground-truth RMS, median over seams. Phase 1 §2.3's test: a **cold
start** is head-weighted and decays over ~4,000 samples; **rounding** is flat.

| samples into chunk | 0–256 | 256–512 | 512–1024 | 1024–2048 | 2048–4096 | 4096–8192 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| l-020 stateless | 0.151 | 0.289 | 0.538 | 0.422 | 0.297 | 0.278 |
| l-020 **state-cached** | **0.012** | **0.009** | **0.007** | **0.008** | **0.010** | **0.011** |
| l-021 stateless | 0.162 | 0.379 | 0.665 | 0.530 | 0.503 | 0.259 |
| l-021 **state-cached** | **0.005** | **0.005** | **0.006** | **0.018** | **0.018** | **0.017** |
| m-020 stateless | 0.131 | 0.163 | 0.264 | 0.292 | 0.314 | 0.220 |
| m-020 **state-cached** | **0.015** | **0.008** | **0.005** | **0.006** | **0.006** | **0.013** |

The state-cached profile is flat on all three. Story 20.4's cold-start signature
is removed, not reduced — the Phase 1 bench result reproduced by the shipped
code on the production path.

---

## 3. The regression bar — exact, not statistical

Phase 1 §2.5 established that a streaming decode with state carried is bit-exact
against `forward` in fp32 and identical to the whole-sequence decode to the float
floor. That, not a tolerance, is what the test suite holds the implementation to.

### 3.1 On a real decoder, in CI, on CPU

`test_codec_state_cache.py` builds a genuine `Qwen3TTSTokenizerV2Decoder` from
the real upstream classes — tiny (2 transformer layers, latent 8, 8
samples/frame, 6-sample edge loss) with randomised weights — so the exactness
assertions run in float64 on CPU in 3 seconds. Nothing there is a mock of the
decoder; a mock could not detect the one bug that matters.

| assertion | result |
|---|---|
| single-chunk streaming == `decoder.forward` | **`torch.equal` — bit-for-bit** |
| chunked with state == whole sequence, chunk ∈ {5, 8, 10, 13} | 2.8e-16 – 3.4e-16 (float64 floor) |
| stitched worker output == whole-sequence decode, cs=10 la=3, 43 frames | ≤ 1e-06 |
| retained overlap tail == next chunk's head | **`assert_array_equal` — bit-for-bit** |
| independent decodes lose `edge_loss` per seam | exact |
| stateless control still shows the cold-start defect | 0.377 head NRMSE — the fixture reproduces Story 20.4's ~35 % |

### 3.2 The bias trap, pinned as its own row

`test_transposed_conv_bias_is_not_double_counted` monkeypatches the naive
overlap-add in and requires it to be catastrophically worse:

| | NRMSE vs whole-sequence | length |
|---|---|---|
| corrected (shipped) | 3.2e-16 | correct |
| naive — bias double-counted | **2.2e-02** | **correct** |

Seven orders of magnitude apart, and note the second column: **the naive form
gets the length right**, which is exactly why it is dangerous — every geometry
check still passes and the failure presents as "state caching does not work".

### 3.3 On the loaded model, at build time

The runtime self-test measured on this host (bf16, RTX 5090):

| | random 24 frames | random 50 frames | real l-020 tokens, 50 frames |
|---|---|---|---|
| single-call streaming vs `forward` | **0.0 (bit-exact)** | **0.0 (bit-exact)** | **0.0 (bit-exact)** |
| chunked with state vs `forward` | 5.1e-02 | 3.3e-02 | **8.6e-03** |
| naive bias vs `forward` | 6.0e-02 | 5.9e-02 | 3.5e-02 |
| no state (INDEP) vs `forward` | 9.4e-01 | 1.13e+00 | 1.07e+00 |

Two things this table settles.

**The traversal is bit-exact against `forward` on the real model in bf16.** That
is a stronger statement than Phase 1 made and it is precision-independent, so it
is the gate the self-test is built on.

**And a limitation, stated rather than papered over.** On *random* codes the
bf16 floor (3.3e-02 – 5.1e-02) is too close to the bias bug's signature
(5.9e-02) to separate them, and the self-test has no real tokens at build time.
So the runtime self-test does **not** gate the bias trap. That is acceptable
because the bias trap is a code defect, not a model mismatch — it cannot appear
at runtime without the source changing — and §3.2 pins it in CI with six orders
of margin. An earlier draft used a 5e-02 tolerance that would have *failed on
correct code* (measured 5.13e-02 on the first real run); the fix was to
re-derive the gate, not to loosen the number.

### 3.4 The trip-wire extension

Nine rows added to `tests/test_qwen_tts_internals.py`, pinning what the wrapper
depends on and could otherwise lose silently: the eight module classes the
traversal dispatches on; the seven fragments of `Decoder.forward` that
`stream_forward` restates; the zero left-pad that is this story's whole premise;
the `[left_pad : −right_pad]` discard that owns 100 % of the 555; the five
decoder attribute names; `layer_types == ["sliding_attention"] * 8`; the
`upsample_rates` arithmetic that yields 1920 and 555; `Model.decode` still
routing through `chunked_decode` and *not* `forward_optimized` (Phase 1's
no-CUDA-graph-trade finding); and the `DynamicCache` rebind-not-mutate contract
the free snapshot depends on.

---

## 4. AC #3's other requirement: the two smoothing layers, on evidence

AC #3 says the Story 20.4 seam fix must be **re-evaluated, not assumed**. Phase 1
§4.2 added the 64-sample consumer crossfade to that. Both were measured. **Neither
was changed** — that is a follow-up with its own audition, and bundling it here
would repeat the two-variable confound that cost Story 20.4 its round-2 audition.

### 4.1 The Story 20.4 1,024-sample decoder seam blend — now inert

The blend cross-fades the tail a chunk retains past its splice against the head
of the chunk that follows. Under carried state the retained tail is decoded from
the *same state snapshot* the next chunk resumes from, so the two are the same
audio.

| how different are the blend's two inputs? (NRMSE, median over seams / max) | l-020 | l-021 | m-020 |
|---|---|---|---|
| stateless (ships today) | 0.472 / 0.987 | 0.556 / 0.591 | 0.223 / 0.223 |
| **state-cached** | **0.0037 / 0.087** | **0.0044 / 0.012** | **0.0046 / 0.0046** |

The blend's inputs now agree to about **−48 dB median**, a ~125× reduction. On
CPU in float64 they are bit-for-bit identical
(`test_overlap_add_is_an_identity_under_carried_state`); the residual on GPU is
bf16 kernel-selection noise between a 25-frame pass and a 5-frame pass over the
same frames.

**Verdict: the blend is now an identity operation.** It neither helps nor harms.
Leaving it in place costs nothing measurable and keeps Phase 2 to one variable;
removing it would change the output by ~0.4 % over the 2.1 % of the stream inside
a blend window. It should be removed eventually — dead weight in the hot path —
but there is no quality argument either way, and no reason to spend an audition
on it alone.

### 4.2 The 64-sample consumer crossfade — now the dominant error term

`StreamingChunkBuffer._apply_crossfade_and_update_tail` blends the **last** 64
samples of one released chunk with the **first** 64 of the next. Those are
*different moments in time*: sample `n+i` gets mixed with sample `n−64+i`. On a
genuine discontinuity that bridges a step. On continuous audio it is a 2.7 ms
comb over material that needed no repair.

Measured against ground truth — does it move the output toward or away from what
the codec actually produced?

| arm | samples touched | max │Δ│ | NRMSE vs ground truth, crossfade **off** | crossfade **on** | effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| l-020 stateless | 566 / 442,965 (0.128 %) | 7,949 LSB | 0.208193 | 0.209932 | +0.8 % worse |
| l-020 **state-cached** | 565 / 442,965 (0.128 %) | 8,123 LSB | **0.009876** | **0.025432** | **2.6× worse** |
| l-021 stateless | 378 / 337,365 (0.112 %) | 10,910 LSB | 0.602772 | 0.603511 | +0.1 % worse |
| l-021 **state-cached** | 377 / 337,365 (0.112 %) | 11,518 LSB | **0.010198** | **0.033743** | **3.3× worse** |
| m-020 stateless | 63 / 83,925 (0.075 %) | 4,218 LSB | 0.163148 | 0.163729 | +0.4 % worse |
| m-020 **state-cached** | 63 / 83,925 (0.075 %) | 3,250 LSB | **0.079059** | **0.079474** | +0.5 % worse |

Read carefully. The crossfade was *already* mildly harmful on the shipped arm —
it is applied at the consumer buffer's **release** boundaries, which since Story
20.4's decoder-side blend have been continuous audio anyway — but its harm was
invisible under a cold-start error 20× larger. Remove the cold start and the
crossfade becomes **the largest remaining deviation from the codec's true
output**: it triples the error on both long fixtures while touching 0.1 % of
samples, with local excursions up to 0.35 full scale.

**Verdict: this one should probably go, and it is a real change with a real
expected effect** — unlike §4.1. It is therefore exactly the kind of thing that
must not ride along on this audition. Recorded as the primary Story 20.5
follow-up: *remove or shorten the 64-sample `StreamingChunkBuffer` crossfade,
audition it on its own.* It is one constant
(`streaming_chunk_buffer.py:94 crossfade_samples=64`) and the class already
supports 0.

Note also that it is **not** load-bearing for underrun smoothing — that job
belongs to the 500 ms watermark (Story 18.x), which is untouched.

---

## 5. Cost, measured on the shipped path

### 5.1 Memory — as Phase 1 predicted

| | tensors | bytes |
|---|---|---|
| after 4 chunks (KV sliding window full) | 37 | 2,609,472 (2.49 MiB) |
| after all 10 chunks (231 frames) | 37 | 2,609,472 (2.49 MiB) |

**Bounded: identical.** The KV cache self-bounds at `sliding_window=72`, so
per-session cost is constant in utterance length. 2.49 MiB per concurrent
session; nothing here needs a memory budget conversation.

### 5.2 Decode time — a regression, and it is the lookahead's fault

This is where the shipped implementation **differs from the Phase 1 bench**, and
the difference is worth stating plainly rather than burying.

| utterance | chunks | stateless | state-cached | Δ | per chunk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| l-020 | 10 | 199.4 ms | 285.0 ms | +42.9 % | **+8.6 ms** |
| l-021 | 7 | 150.3 ms | 223.0 ms | +48.4 % | **+10.4 ms** |
| m-020 | 2 | 63.7 ms | 77.6 ms | +21.8 % | **+7.0 ms** |

Best of two timed passes each, after a warm-up pass on the same shapes.

Phase 1 §3.2 measured carried state as **21–30 % faster**. It was — but its bench
decoded 25 frames in **one** call with no lookahead. The shipped path must
preserve the 5-frame lookahead and the post-decode trim (this story's explicit
constraint), so each chunk is decoded in **two** passes: 25 frames committed,
then 5 frames on a snapshot that is thrown away. The decoder is launch-overhead
dominated at these tensor sizes, so two calls cost close to twice the fixed
overhead of one. That is the whole of the +8.6 ms.

Is it acceptable? Yes, and the numbers say why:

- A chunk carries **2,000 ms** of audio. Decode goes from ~20 ms to ~29 ms per
  chunk — **1.0 % → 1.5 % of real time**. Story 18.1 pinned the producer
  bottleneck at the talker (31 % of real time, ratio 3.23×); this moves that
  ratio by about 0.02.
- TTFA takes the hit once: the first chunk's decode is ~9 ms longer against a
  measured 1,491 ms long-form TTFA — **+0.6 %**.

And it is recoverable, two ways, both of which are follow-ups rather than this
story:

1. **Drop the lookahead** (Phase 1 §4.1). With state carried, a chunk decodes
   exactly its own 25 frames and the trim has no remaining job. That deletes the
   second pass — decode becomes *faster* than today, per Phase 1 — and fires the
   first chunk after 25 talker steps instead of 30, which is a TTFA win on top.
   Blocked here only because it also removes the 1,024-sample blend's input,
   which §4.1 shows is inert but which this story is not changing.
2. **Single-pass state capture.** The frame-25 boundary maps to a known sample
   index at every stage's resolution, so the state could be sliced out mid-pass
   instead of re-running 5 frames. More code, more risk, no behavioural change.
   Recorded, not recommended yet.

### 5.3 CUDA graphs — Phase 1's finding holds

`_compiled_forward` is set but is only reachable through `forward_optimized`,
which `chunked_decode` does not call. The compiled decoder graph is not on
MyVoice's decode path, so nothing is traded away. Pinned by
`test_v2_model_decode_still_routes_to_chunked_decode_then_forward`.

`test_audio_chunk_field_set_unchanged`. None touches streaming.

**One test-side change was required.** `_build_true_stream_decode_fn` grew two
optional geometry parameters (the state-cached decoder commits at the streamer's
splice, so it must be built *from* the streamer's geometry rather than from
module defaults). Fifteen test doubles of that builder took `(model)` only and
were widened to `(model, *_geometry, **_kwargs)`. They return a stateless
decode_fn with no `carries_codec_state` attribute, so those tests keep exercising
the pre-20.5 geometry model — which is correct: they are about callback and
metric wiring, not about the codec.

## 7. Phase 3 (AC #4) — pre-registration

**Nothing has been auditioned yet.** This section is written *before* the round,
which is the practice that made Story 20.4 rounds 3 and 4 readable.

### 7.1 The arms

    reference = cs25 + the Story 20.4 seam fix                 <- what ships today
    candidate = cs25 + the Story 20.4 seam fix + state caching

Both carry the same geometry (25, 5), the same 1,024-sample decoder blend and the
same 64-sample consumer crossfade. Both are rendered through a real
`StreamingDecoderWorker` and a real `StreamingChunkBuffer`, from one model load,
in one process. The generator's preflight refuses to run if `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`
or `DEFAULT_LOOKAHEAD` has drifted.

Same seven utterances as Story 20.4 rounds 1–4, so every round stays comparable.

### 7.2 The variance requirement — answered by removing the confound, not averaging it

AC #4 offers two options: multiple takes per condition, or state plainly that the
round can only detect a large effect. This round takes a third, which Story 20.4
could not:

> **Both files in every pair are decoded from one talker run.**

The talker runs once per take; its codec-token chunks are captured and decoded
twice. Within a pair the wording, prosody, pauses and total duration are
identical *to the sample*; the only difference is whether the decoder carried
state. Story 20.4's arms were necessarily different takes — a chunk-size change
perturbs what the streamer emits and therefore what the talker samples — and
§17 recorded the consequence: the same configuration flagging differently across
takes. Nothing upstream of the decoder is touched by this story, so the tokens
are literally reused.

So a single pair per utterance is already sufficient for **attribution**: any
difference heard is caused by the decode, because there is nothing else it could
be caused by. That is a stronger position than either option the AC offered, and
it means the round is **not** limited to detecting a large effect.

**Two takes per utterance are still generated**, for a different reason: to
sample the *content* lottery — whether a held vowel or a plosive happens to land
on a boundary is luck, and one take might contain no seam-sensitive material at
all. 7 utterances × 2 takes = **14 trials**.

Levels are deliberately **not** normalised. Story 20.4 round 4 normalised because
its arms were different takes that differed by 8 dB; here they share a take, so
any level difference is *caused by the change* and is a finding. The generator
prints the within-pair delta and warns above 0.2 dB.

### 7.3 The falsifiable prediction, recorded before listening

- **P1 (BLOCKING).** No blocking seam defect — `audible_seam`,
  `click_or_discontinuity`, `prosody_break_at_stitch` — on any candidate trial.
  *Falsified by one.*
- **P2 (DIRECTION).** Where the two differ, the candidate is preferred; the
  reference is never preferred on seam grounds. *Falsified if the reference is
  preferred on ≥ 4 of 14 trials.*
- **P3 (MAGNITUDE).** `equivalent` is the modal answer, **6–11 of 14 trials.**
  Story 20.4 round 3 already certified cs25 + blend as clean to this listener, so
  there is little audible headroom left at this seam density — the blend was
  masking the defect adequately at 25. *Falsified in either direction:* ≥ 10
  candidate-preferred is a large effect; ≤ 4 equivalent means the arms are far
  more distinguishable than predicted and the round needs re-reading before any
  conclusion.
- **P4 (LOCATION).** Any heard difference is on l-020 / l-021 (8–9 seams).
  s-020 / s-021 / s-022 carry 0–1 seams and should be indistinguishable.
  *Falsified by a difference heard on a short fixture but not a long one.*

**P3 is the interesting one, and it predicts against the exciting outcome.** The
offline numbers in §2 are dramatic — 50–60× less seam error, zero lag jitter —
and it would be easy to assume that must be audible. It probably is not, at
cs25, because Story 20.4 already established that the 1,024-sample blend masks
this defect well enough at this seam density for Commander to call it clean.
A large effect *is* plausible — Phase 1 removed the cause rather than masking it,
and masking is never perfect — but it is offered here as a prediction to be
falsified, not as an expectation.

A round that returns "equivalent everywhere, no new defects" is a **PASS**. The
prize is not audible quality at cs25; it is that the harm which killed cs10 is
gone at the cause, and AC #5 reopens the chunk-size question as its own story.
If P3 *is* falsified by a large candidate win, that is itself evidence the blend
was masking less well than round 3 suggested — and it strengthens the AC #5 case.

### 7.4 Verdict gate (blocking, per AC #4)

FAIL if any chunk-boundary artefact is flagged on a candidate trial that the
paired reference does not also carry. A defect on **both** files of a pair is
upstream of the decode — here demonstrably, since they are the same take — and is
recorded rather than blocking.

### 7.5 The fixture, generated and checked

Generated 2026-09-01: **28 WAVs, 14 trials**, in
`20-5-perceptual-fixtures/`, with `_perlistener_truthtable.json` and
`_manifest.json`. Chunk counts run from 1 (s-020 take 1) to 10 (l-020),
i.e. 0 to 9 seams — the span the round needs.

Four validity checks on the generated files, before anyone listens:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| length delta within each pair | **+0 samples on all 14** — the arms share a timeline exactly |
| full-signal RMS delta within each pair | −0.21 dB … +0.19 dB (worst 0.21 dB) |
| the zero-seam trial (s-020 take 1, 29 frames → 1 chunk) | **byte-identical between arms** |
| where the arms differ | 36–72 % of the squared difference falls within ±4,096 samples of a seam, which is 9–16 % of the timeline — a 2.5–5.8× concentration |

The last two are the ones worth reading. **s-020 take 1 has no chunk
boundary, and the two arms come out bit-identical** — a built-in control
proving the change touches nothing but the boundaries. And the difference
energy concentrates around the seams and decays over ~4,000 samples, which is
Story 20.4 §13.2's cold-start profile: the fixture is carrying the defect
under test and not something else.

The generator's own level warning fired once (m-021 take 2, +0.317 dB) and is
a **false alarm**: that figure comes from a −50 dBFS-gated active-speech mean,
and frames sitting on the gate flip in and out between arms. The ungated
full-signal delta for the same pair is +0.19 dB, in line with the rest.
Nothing was normalised.

### 7.6 What the operator runs

The fixture is already generated. Commander runs one command:

```
python310\python.exe _bmad-output\implementation-artifacts\20-5-l1-audition-helper.py L1
```

14 trials, headphones, normal Discord-call volume; trial A then trial B, `[r]`
replays, `[q]` quits and keeps what is recorded. Results append to
`20-5-state-cache-audition.csv` and re-running skips rows already recorded.
The helper unblinds at the end and scores the result against P1–P4 itself.

To regenerate the fixture from scratch (new takes):

```
python310\python.exe _bmad-output\implementation-artifacts\20-5-regen-audition-fixture.py
```

To reproduce this file's measurements:

## 8. Follow-ups this story deliberately did not take

> **Superseded — the canonical list, with costs and the F1-before-F2 sequencing
> constraint, now lives in `20-5-codec-state-caching.md` under "Follow-ups — the
> canonical list".** Kept here only as a pointer so two lists cannot drift apart.

Short form: **F1** drop the lookahead + trim (removes the +7–10 ms/chunk tax, which is the
lookahead's doing, not state caching's — and gains 5 talker steps of TTFA); **F2** reopen
`chunk_size`, which discharges AC #5 and **must come after F1**; **F3** retire the now-inert
1,024-sample decoder seam blend, cheap if bundled into a round already running; **F4**
single-pass state capture (moot if F1 lands); **F5** persist fixture tokens; **F6** RTX 3060
confirmation and **F7** the qasync call-site audit, both outstanding from earlier stories
rather than created here.

## §N. Phase 3 audition — MIXED. State caching works; the crossfade it unmasked does not. 2026-09-01

14 trials, L1 solo, blinded. Candidate = `cs25 + fix + state caching`;
reference = `cs25 + fix` (ships today). Both arms decoded from **one** talker run.

| trial | reference | candidate (+state) | preferred | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| l-020-t1 | click | click | **state** | shared |
| l-020-t2 | click | audible_seam | **state** | shared |
| l-021-t1 | tonal_distortion | click | **state** | shared |
| l-021-t2 | tonal_distortion | click | **state** | shared |
| m-020-t1 | click | click | **state** | shared |
| m-020-t2 | none | **click** | ref | **BLOCKING** |
| m-021-t1 | click | click | ref | shared |
| m-021-t2 | none | none | equivalent | clean |
| s-020-t1 | none | none | equivalent | clean *(byte-identical control — passed)* |
| s-020-t2 | none | **click** | ref | **BLOCKING** |
| s-021-t1/t2, s-022-t1/t2 | none | none | equivalent | clean |

**Preference: state 5 — reference 3 — equivalent 6.** Two blocking rows.

### The prediction was wrong in both directions, and informatively

P3 predicted `equivalent` as modal at 6–11 of 14. It is modal at exactly 6 — the
bottom of the range — because **both arms flagged far more often than rounds 3–4
did on the same utterances**. Round 3 scored `cs25+fix` clean on l-020 and l-021;
here it flags on six rows. That is a fixture-construction difference, not a code
one: this round reuses a single talker run per pair, so the content is a
different realisation with different seam exposure, and 14 trials sample more
content than 7.

### What the data actually says

**Where both arms flag, the candidate is preferred 5–1**, and the listener's own
notes are consistent and directional: *"B click was minor compared to A"*,
*"A clicks were very minor"*, *"very minor pops at the seam compared to the rest
of the clicks noted"*. State caching is audibly *better* on the rows where the
seam is exposed.

**The two blocking rows are the problem, and they have a named cause.** §"two
smoothing layers" of this evidence predicted it before the audition ran:

> *The 64-sample `StreamingChunkBuffer` crossfade is now the dominant error term.
> It blends different moments (sample `n+i` with `n−64+i`), so on continuous
> audio it is a 2.7 ms comb… 2.6×/3.3× worse against ground truth.*

That is exactly the observed signature. The crossfade was **masking** while the
cold start dominated; with the cold start removed it is the largest remaining
error and becomes audible on its own. `m-020-t2` and `s-020-t2` are single-seam
rows where the reference's cold start happened not to be audible and the
candidate's newly-unmasked comb is.

**The byte-identical control passed** (`s-020-t1`, no seam, both arms identical →
`equivalent`), so the fixture is sound.

### Verdict and recommendation

**Do not revert.** The mechanism result stands: head NRMSE 0.406 → 0.0078,
correlation 1.0000, zero lag jitter, error-by-position flat. The cause of
`cs10`'s failure is removed.

**The one-variable discipline surfaced a real coupling rather than hiding it.**
Leaving the crossfade in was correct for attribution and is precisely why we can
name the blocker instead of guessing at it.

**Next: neutralise the 64-sample crossfade with state caching in place, then
re-audition.** It already has measured evidence against it (2.6×/3.3× worse
against ground truth, touching 0.13 % of samples) and no remaining argument for
it — its job was masking a discontinuity that no longer exists. That is one
variable, one round.

Story 20.4's 1,024-sample seam blend is a separate question: it is now an
identity (inputs differ by NRMSE 0.0037–0.0046, bit-identical in fp64), so it is
harmless but pointless. Remove it in the same pass only if the evidence says it
is *provably* inert; if there is any doubt, leave it and change one thing.

---

## §9. Phase 4 — neutralising the consumer crossfade (the round-1 blocker)

Round 1's two blocking rows had a cause this file named before the round ran.
Phase 4 removes it. **One variable:** the 64-sample `StreamingChunkBuffer`
crossfade. Nothing else moves — not `chunk_size`, not the lookahead, not the
trim, not the 1,024-sample decoder seam blend.

### 9.1 Remove, reduce, or gate? — the decision, on evidence

**Gate it.** Neither of the other two options survives contact with the
measurements.

**Not "reduce".** The harm is qualitative, not proportional. The crossfade
blends the last K samples of one released chunk with the first K of the next —
sample `n+i` mixed with sample `n−64+i` — which on continuous audio is a comb
filter with notches at odd multiples of `sample_rate / 2K`. Halving K moves the
notches up and shortens the artefact; it does not make the operation correct.
There is no width at which cross-dissolving a signal with its own past is right.
Picking 32 would trade one arbitrary constant for another and would still have
to be auditioned.

**Not "remove globally".** The same buffer is on **SENTENCE_STREAM**. That path
butt-splices independently generated sentences, so its chunk boundaries are
genuine discontinuities and the crossfade is doing the job it was written for.
Story 20.5 has measured *nothing* on that path. Removing the crossfade outright
would silently change audio this story never looked at — precisely the failure
mode the coordinator flagged.

**Gating is what the evidence actually supports.** The crossfade's premise is
*"consecutive chunks are independent renderings butt-spliced together, so bridge
the step."* That premise is a property of the **producer**, and it is now false
for exactly one producer: TRUE_STREAM with codec state caching engaged, whose
posted chunks concatenate into the codec's true output sample for sample (§2).
So the producer declares it and the consumer acts on it. Everything else keeps
today's behaviour bit-for-bit.

And on the declared-continuous stream, **0 is not "less of a bad thing" — it is
the correct value**, because the concatenation is then exactly what the codec
produced. §4.2 measured that directly: crossfade-off is 2.6×/3.3× closer to
ground truth than crossfade-on.

### 9.2 The blast radius, mapped rather than assumed

`StreamingChunkBuffer` is constructed in exactly one place
(`audio_coordinator.py:start_streaming_session`) and consumed in exactly one
(`AudioCoordinator.play_audio_chunk`), which has exactly one production caller
(`MyVoiceApp._handle_progressive_chunk_async`). That consumer serves **two**
producers, and app.py's own comment says so:

> *Covers SENTENCE_STREAM's last data chunk (is_final=True with real
> audio_data) AND TRUE_STREAM's data chunks (is_final=False).*

An AST sweep confirms only two methods emit AudioChunks at all —
`_generate_streaming` (SENTENCE_STREAM) and `_generate_true_stream`. **The batch
path never opens a progressive session**: it plays through `play_dual_stream`,
which does not touch `_streaming_buffer`. So the crossfade is on TRUE_STREAM and
SENTENCE_STREAM, and not on batch.

| path | chunks continuous? | crossfade after Phase 4 |
|---|---|---|
| TRUE_STREAM + state caching | **yes** — sample-exact concatenation | **0** |
| TRUE_STREAM, stateless fallback / kill switch set | no — each chunk decodes cold | 64 (unchanged) |
| SENTENCE_STREAM | no — independently generated sentences | 64 (unchanged) |
| BATCH | n/a — never opens a progressive session | n/a |

### 9.3 The wiring

Three small changes, each in the layer that owns the knowledge:

1. **`QwenTTSService`** gains `_progressive_stream_continuous`, set at the top
   of every dispatch path that emits AudioChunks — `_generate_true_stream` reads
   it off `decode_fn.carries_codec_state`, `_generate_streaming` sets `False`.
   Exposed as the read-only property `progressive_stream_is_continuous`.
2. **`AudioCoordinator.start_streaming_session`** gains
   `crossfade_samples: Optional[int] = None`. `None` means the 64-sample
   default, so every pre-existing caller is unaffected; a non-default value is
   logged.
3. **`MyVoiceApp._handle_progressive_chunk_async`** passes
   `crossfade_samples=0` iff the producer declares continuity, via a
   double-guarded `getattr` so an app without a wired TTS service falls through
   to today's behaviour rather than raising inside the session-open try.

`StreamingChunkBuffer` itself is **unchanged** — it already accepted and
validated 0, and `test_crossfade_disabled_passes_through_unchanged` already
pinned that 0 means untouched.

**Reading the declaration off the decode_fn rather than hard-coding `True` is
load-bearing.** It means the stateless fallback and the
`MYVOICE_CODEC_STATE_CACHE` kill switch each keep the crossfade they still need,
automatically, with no second place to keep in sync.

### 9.4 The staleness trap, and the test that closes it

The flag is per-generation state on a long-lived service. If only
`_generate_true_stream` set it, a TRUE_STREAM generation would leave `True`
behind and the **next SENTENCE_STREAM generation would silently lose its
crossfade** — a cross-path audio change on a path this story never measured, and
one that no single-generation test would ever catch.

`test_every_audio_chunk_producer_declares_stream_continuity` is an AST source
invariant, in the spirit of the Story 20.2 `_audio_chunk_sink` rule: it derives
the set of AudioChunk-emitting `_generate*` methods from the source and requires
every one of them to assign the flag in its own body. It currently finds
`{_generate_streaming, _generate_true_stream}` as both producers and assigners,
and it fails loudly if a third producer is ever added without a declaration.

Ten tests in `tests/unit/services/test_consumer_crossfade_scoping.py` cover the
pass-through default, `None`-means-default (getting that backwards would strip
the crossfade from SENTENCE_STREAM), explicit 0, the log line, the flag's safe
`False` default before any generation, its derivation from the decode_fn, the
source invariant, and the consumer's defensive lookup.

### 9.5 What was NOT changed, and why

**The Story 20.4 1,024-sample decoder seam blend stays.** The coordinator's
instruction was to remove it only if it is *provably* inert. It is not — not in
the shipping regime. §4.1 measured its two inputs differing by NRMSE 0.0037–
0.0046 median **with a maximum of 8.7e-02** on one l-020 seam. Bit-identical in
fp64 on CPU is not the same claim as inert in bf16 on a 5090, and an 8.7e-02
worst-case over a 1,024-sample window is not nothing. It is *nearly* inert,
which is not the standard that was set. It stays, and this round changes one
thing.

---

## §10. Phase 3 round 2 — pre-registration (AC #4)

**Not yet run.** Written before the round, as with round 1.

### 10.1 The arms

    reference = cs25 + fix + state caching + 64-sample consumer crossfade
    candidate = cs25 + fix + state caching + NO consumer crossfade

**Both arms carry state caching.** Round 1 already scored state caching against
what ships today (preferred 5–1 wherever the seam was exposed); this round holds
that fixed and varies only the crossfade, which is the one thing that can
attribute the two blocking rows.

The crossfade width for each arm is **derived** by the same rule the shipped
wiring uses — `0 if decode_fn.carries_codec_state else 64` — rather than
hard-coded in the fixture, so the fixture cannot render an arm production would
not produce. The generator's preflight also refuses to run unless
`AudioCoordinator.start_streaming_session` actually has the `crossfade_samples`
parameter and `QwenTTSService` actually exposes the continuity property, so a
round cannot audition a configuration that is unreachable in the product.

**A third arm is rendered but not auditioned.** Every take is also rendered as
`cs25fix` — stateless decode plus the 64-sample crossfade, i.e. exactly what
ships today. It is not in the truth table and costs no listening time. It exists
because the talker is stochastic: a close-out comparison of "state caching + no
crossfade" against "ships today" is only worth anything if it comes from the
*same* takes, and those takes exist only while the generator is running.
Rendering it now makes that comparison a truth-table edit rather than a
regeneration.

### 10.2 The fixture, generated and checked

28 auditioned WAVs (42 rendered), 14 trials, in `20-5-perceptual-fixtures-r2/`.
Chunk counts run 1–10, i.e. 0–9 seams.

| check | result |
|---|---|
| length delta within each pair | **+0 samples on all 14** |
| worst within-pair active-RMS level delta | **0.004 dB** (round 1: 0.32 dB) |
| zero-seam trial (s-020 take 2, 28 frames → 1 chunk) | **byte-identical between arms** |
| where the arms differ | **100 % of the squared difference is inside a ±4,096-sample window around a seam, on every trial** |
| how many samples differ | **exactly 63 per boundary** — the crossfade's own width, minus the ramp's zero-weight first sample |
| the third arm | differs from the candidate (max Δ 33,598 LSB); recorded crossfades 64 / 0 / 64 |

That fourth and fifth row are what make this round sharp. The two arms are
**identical everywhere except the 63 samples at each chunk boundary that the
crossfade touches** — this is as clean an isolation as an A/B can be. Peak
excursions inside those windows reach 12,414 LSB (0.38 full scale), which is why
2.7 ms is enough to be audible. Three trials (s-021 t1/t2, s-022 t2) have peak
deltas of only 9–34 LSB because their boundaries land in quiet material; those
are a built-in low-effect control set and should come back `equivalent`.

**One limitation, stated plainly.** Round 2's takes are *new* realisations —
neither generator persisted its captured tokens, so round 1's exact audio could
not be reused. Q1 below therefore tests the utterance *class* that blocked
(`m-020`, `s-020` — the low-seam, exposed rows), not the identical waveforms.
The design still compensates in the way that matters: both arms of every pair
share a take, so attribution within a pair is exact. Persisting captured tokens
is recorded as a follow-up so a future round can reuse exact content.

### 10.3 The falsifiable prediction, recorded before listening

- **Q1 (BLOCKING, the whole point).** The utterances that blocked round 1 —
  `m-020` and `s-020` — come back clean on the candidate: neither carries a
  blocking seam defect its paired reference does not. *Falsified if either still
  flags candidate-only.*
- **Q2 (NO NEW HARM).** No blocking seam defect on any candidate trial anywhere
  in the round. *Falsified by one.*
- **Q3 (DIRECTION).** The candidate is preferred at least as often as the
  reference. *Falsified if the reference is preferred on ≥ 4 of 14.*
- **Q4 (MAGNITUDE).** `equivalent` is modal, **7–12 of 14** — a little higher
  than round 1's 6, because the arms differ on only 0.1 % of samples.
  *Falsified either way:* ≥ 10 candidate-preferred would be a larger effect than
  63 samples per boundary should be able to produce and would mean something
  else moved; ≤ 4 equivalent means the arms are far more separable than a 2.7 ms
  window can explain.
- **Q5 (LOCATION — the one that can embarrass this diagnosis).** Round 1's
  blocking rows were **single-seam** trials, which is the opposite of where
  seam-density reasoning would put them. The Phase 2 measurement says the
  crossfade is a *per-boundary* artefact, so it should be **more** exposed where
  it is not buried under neighbouring seams. So the improvement should show on
  the low-seam rows (`m-020`, `s-020`, `m-021`) at least as much as on the 8–9-
  seam long ones. *Falsified if only the long fixtures improve* — which would
  mean the two blocking rows had a different cause and this round fixed the
  wrong thing.

Q5 is stated first-class deliberately. It is the prediction that, if it fails,
says the diagnosis in §9 is wrong — and a round that cannot embarrass its own
hypothesis is not worth running.

### 10.4 Verdict gate (blocking)

FAIL if any chunk-boundary artefact is flagged on a candidate trial that the
paired reference does not also carry. A defect on both files of a pair is
upstream of the crossfade — demonstrably, since they are the same take decoded
identically outside those 63 samples — and is recorded rather than blocking.

### 10.5 What the operator runs

The round-2 fixture is already generated. One command:

```
python310\python.exe _bmad-output\implementation-artifacts\20-5-l1-audition-helper.py L1 r2
```

14 trials. Results append to `20-5-state-cache-audition-r2.csv`; re-running
skips rows already recorded; the helper unblinds and scores Q1–Q5 itself. Round
1 can be replayed and re-scored with `... 20-5-l1-audition-helper.py L1 r1`.

To regenerate the round-2 fixture (new takes):

## §N+1. Phase 4 audition round 2 — **UNANIMOUS PASS.** 2026-09-01

Arms: `state + 64-sample crossfade` (round 1's blocker) vs `state + no crossfade`.
Crossfade is the only variable; each width derived by the shipped rule.

| | result |
|---|---|
| candidate cleaner | **10 of 14** |
| equivalent | 4 of 14 |
| blocking (candidate-only defect) | **0** |
| shared | **0** |
| **preference** | **no-crossfade 10 — crossfade 0 — equivalent 4** |

**The crossfade arm flagged `click_or_discontinuity` on every single trial that
contained a seam. The no-crossfade arm flagged on none of them.** The four
`equivalent` rows are the zero- and low-seam trials where neither arm had
anything to hear.

### Both round-1 blockers are resolved

`m-020-t2`: reference click → candidate none. `s-020-t2`: clean on both. The two
rows that blocked Phase 3 are exactly the rows the diagnosis said the crossfade
was responsible for.

### The prediction scored

- **Q1** (round-1 blockers come back clean) — **held**, both.
- **Q2** (no candidate-only defect) — **held**, zero.
- **Q3** (reference not preferred ≥4/14) — **held**; preferred **zero** times.
- **Q4** (`equivalent` modal, 7–12) — **falsified, in the good direction.**
  `equivalent` is 4; *candidate cleaner* is modal at 10. The effect is far larger
  than predicted.
- **Q5, the one that could have embarrassed the diagnosis** — **held.** Round 1's
  blockers were single-seam rows, and the prediction was that if the crossfade is
  genuinely a per-boundary artefact the low-seam rows must improve as much as the
  8–9-seam ones. They did: `s-020-t1` and `s-022-t1` (single seam) improved
  exactly as `l-020`/`l-021` did. **The right thing was fixed.**

### What this closes

The chain is complete and each link is measured:

1. The codec zero-pads its left edge, so every chunk decodes from a cold state —
   the cause of both the 555-sample deletion and the ~35 % head error.
2. Carrying state removes it: head NRMSE 0.406 → 0.0078, correlation 1.0000,
   zero lag jitter, error-by-position flat, single-chunk decode bit-exact.
3. That exposed the 64-sample crossfade, which had been masking a discontinuity
   that no longer exists and is a 2.7 ms comb on continuous audio.
4. Scoping the crossfade to discontinuous producers removes the last audible
   seam artefact — unanimously, on 14 blinded trials.

**Story 20.4's precondition for reopening the chunk-size question (§17) is met.**
