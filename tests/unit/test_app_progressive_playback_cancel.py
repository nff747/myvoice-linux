"""Story 17.3 — orchestrator-level progressive-playback cancel chain tests.

Covers AC #4 (Task 4.3):
  - ``test_cancel_mid_stream_stops_streaming_session`` — when
    ``_progressive_playback_active is True``, ``_on_cancel_generation_requested``
    schedules ``AudioCoordinator.stop_streaming_session()`` and clears the
    flag so a subsequent generation opens a fresh session.
  - ``test_cancel_when_progressive_inactive_no_extra_call`` — when the
    flag is False, no ``stop_streaming_session`` schedule fires (defends
    against double-stop on an already-closed session).
