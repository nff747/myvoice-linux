"""Integration smoke tests for the Phase ⊥ True Streaming TTS chain.

Story 16.5 — verifies the cooperative cancellation chain end-to-end with
the REAL Story-16.3 ``CodecTokenStreamer`` and Story-16.4
``StreamingDecoderWorker``, a real ``SessionRegistry``, and a real
``AudioCoordinator`` with mocked monitor + virtual-mic sinks.

Architecture references:
  - P-7 (architecture-optimization-pass.md:443-451): one-direction cancel
    chain — user → registry → streamer's _cancel_event → talker .generate()
    returns → decoder drains → CANCELLED → DISCARDED.
  - Validation gap #3 (lines 835-839): two follow-on actions on cancel —
    (i) audio_coordinator.cancel_playback(session_id), (ii) decoder
    drain-on-cancel drops queued chunks.
  - File map (lines 639-641): this file is the Phase ⊥ smoke-test sibling
    of the unit tests in tests/unit/services/tts_streaming/.

Test design — wakeup invariant
------------------------------
The Story-16.4 ``StreamingDecoderWorker._run`` checks ``_cancel_event``
at the top of each loop iteration but otherwise blocks on
``streamer.queue.get()``. Once cancel fires, ``streamer.put()`` becomes
a no-op (Story 16.3 D-11), so a worker that has drained the queue stays
blocked indefinitely on ``get()``. To verify the cancel chain in
isolation, these tests pre-fill the queue with enough chunks that the
worker is still consuming when cancel fires — the next iteration's top-
of-loop check sees the event, ``_drain_and_post_cancel()`` runs (drops
remaining chunks via ``get_nowait``), and the worker exits. In real
production (Story 16.6's TRUE_STREAM dispatch), the talker thread
running HF ``.generate()`` continuously feeds the queue, so the worker
is naturally still consuming when cancel fires; the pre-fill is the
test-rig analogue of "talker is still running."

This file does NOT exercise Story 16.6 (TRUE_STREAM dispatch in
QwenTTSService.generate). The streamer + worker pair is constructed
inline by the test rig, simulating the wiring that Story 16.6 will
eventually compose in production.

# The Story 16.6 / 16.7 smoke tests above ALL monkey-patch
# ``service._build_true_stream_talker`` to inject a controlled token-feeding
# closure. That patching is what allowed Story 16.6's structural wire-up
# bug — ``model.model.generate(streamer=streamer)`` with no conditioning
# args — to ship: every test bypassed the real builder. This class is the
# regression guard against another silent wire-up failure ever recurring:
# it exercises the REAL ``_build_true_stream_talker`` body (the talker-patch
# variant of Path A from Story 16.8) with a fake-model fixture whose
# attribute graph satisfies the wire-up's runtime contract — a reachable
# ``model.model.talker.generate`` call that the patch can interpose on,
# and a ``model.generate_custom_voice`` that drives the wrapper through to
# that call site.

    step_count: int = 100, num_code_groups: int = 4,
):
    """Build a MagicMock whose attribute graph satisfies Story 16.8's
    forward-hook wire-up.

    Story 16.8 finding (2026-05-07): HF ``GenerationMixin._sample``'s
    standard ``streamer.put(next_tokens)`` protocol fires only with the
    main-codebook token; the qwen-tts talker is multi-codebook and the
    12Hz speech-tokenizer's ``decode`` requires
    ``(N_steps, num_code_groups)`` per sample. The production fix
    captures ``codec_ids`` via a ``talker.forward`` hook (each forward
    call returns ``Qwen3TTSTalkerOutputWithPast.hidden_states[1] = codec_ids``
    of shape ``(batch=1, num_code_groups)``).

    This fixture mimics that contract:
      - ``talker.forward`` is called step_count + 1 times (1 prefill +
        step_count generation steps). Prefill returns ``codec_ids=None``;
        each generation step returns a deterministic
        ``(1, num_code_groups)`` tensor.
      - ``talker.generate`` simulates HF ``_sample``'s loop by invoking
        ``talker.forward`` step_count + 1 times.
      - ``generate_custom_voice`` (and the two siblings) simulate the
        public wrapper by invoking ``talker.generate``.

    The fixture does NOT replace ``_build_true_stream_talker`` itself —
    that is the body under test. The forward-hook installed by
    ``_build_true_stream_talker`` interposes on ``talker.forward``,
    captures codec_ids, accumulates into step_buffer, and pushes chunks
    to ``streamer.queue`` when ``chunk_size + lookahead`` steps land.

    The chunk count follows the committed geometry: at the pre-Story-20.4
    defaults (chunk_size=25, lookahead=5) ``step_count=100`` produced 3
    chunks during generation (push points at 30 / 55 / 80 steps; slide
    forward by 25 each time keeps the last 5 as overlap) plus 1 residual
    chunk on flush. Story 20.4 attempted 10 + 5 (denser push points) and
    reverted it; the committed geometry is 25 + 5 again.
    ``_expected_chunk_count`` is the arithmetic; no test in this file
    restates the number.

    Returns ``(mock_model, hits)`` where ``hits`` is a dict captured by
    the fake methods so tests can assert on call counts.
